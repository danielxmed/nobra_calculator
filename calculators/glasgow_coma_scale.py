Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) Calculator

The Glasgow Coma Scale is a clinical scale used to reliably measure a person's level 
of consciousness after a brain injury. It was developed by Graham Teasdale and Bryan 
Jennett in 1974 and has become the most widely used neurological assessment tool 
internationally. The scale assesses three aspects of responsiveness: eye opening, 
verbal response, and motor response.
