Graded Prognostic Assessment for Gastrointestinal Cancer (GI-GPA) Calculator

The GI-GPA is a validated prognostic tool for estimating survival in patients with 
gastrointestinal cancers who develop brain metastases. It uses four key prognostic 
factors to stratify patients into different survival groups, helping guide treatment 
decisions and prognostic discussions.

The score helps clinicians:
- Estimate survival for patients with GI cancers and brain metastases
- Guide treatment selection (aggressive multimodal therapy vs. palliative care)
- Support end-of-life decision-making and goals of care discussions
- Stratify patients for clinical trials involving brain metastases
- Facilitate multidisciplinary team treatment planning
