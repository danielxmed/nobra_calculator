Acute Interstitial Nephritis (AIN) Risk Calculator

Identifies the likelihood of acute interstitial nephritis in at-risk patients 
undergoing kidney biopsy evaluation. Developed by Dr. Dennis G. Moledina at Yale 
School of Medicine using multicenter data from Yale, Indiana University, and 
Johns Hopkins University.
