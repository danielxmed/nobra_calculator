- **Validated**: Robust parameter validation with Pydantic
- **Interpreted**: Returns not only the result but also the clinical interpretation

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielxmed/nobra_calculator.git
cd nobra_calculator
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. (Optional) Configure environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env file with your specific configuration
```

5. Run the API:
```bash
python main.py
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

The API can be configured using environment variables. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust the values:

#### CORS Configuration
```bash
# Comma-separated list of allowed origins for CORS
# For development (default):
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3001,http://127.0.0.1:3000,http://127.0.0.1:3001

# For production, specify your actual domain(s):
CORS_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com,https://www.yourdomain.com
```

#### Rate Limiting (Optional)
```bash
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=your-redis-password
REQ_PER_SEC=10
WHITE_LIST=["192.168.1.1","10.0.0.1"]
```

#### Server Configuration
```bash
PORT=8000
```

### Frontend Integration

The API is configured to work with frontend applications. Make sure to:

1. Set the correct CORS origins in your environment variables
2. Use the appropriate API endpoints in your frontend code
3. Handle CORS preflight requests properly

Example frontend fetch:
```javascript
// Make sure your frontend domain is included in CORS_ORIGINS
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8000/api/scores', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
});
```

## 🔧 Adding New Scores

To add a new score:

### 1. Create the JSON metadata file
Create `/scores/{score_id}.json` with the score metadata:
```json
{
  "id": "new_score",
  "title": "Score Title",
  "description": "Detailed description",
  "category": "medical_specialty",
  "parameters": [...],
  "result": {...},
  "interpretation": {...}
}
```

### 2. Create the calculation module
Create `/calculators/{score_id}.py`:
```python
def calculate_new_score(param1, param2):
    # Calculation logic
    result = ...
    return {
        "result": result,
        "unit": "unit",
        "interpretation": "interpretation"
    }
```

### 3. Create the Pydantic models
Create `/app/models/scores/{specialty}/{score_id}.py`:
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class NewScoreRequest(BaseModel):
    """Request model for New Score"""
    param1: str = Field(..., description="Parameter 1")
    param2: float = Field(..., description="Parameter 2")

class NewScoreResponse(BaseModel):
    """Response model for New Score"""
    result: float = Field(..., description="Calculation result")
    unit: str = Field(..., description="Result unit")
    interpretation: str = Field(..., description="Clinical interpretation")
```

### 4. Create the router endpoint
Create `/app/routers/scores/{specialty}/{score_id}.py`:
```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException
from app.models.scores.{specialty}.{score_id} import NewScoreRequest, NewScoreResponse
from app.services.calculator_service import calculator_service

router = APIRouter()

@router.post("/new_score", response_model=NewScoreResponse)
async def calculate_new_score(request: NewScoreRequest):
    """Calculate New Score"""
    try:
        result = calculator_service.calculate_score("new_score", request.dict())
        return NewScoreResponse(**result)
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
```

### 5. Update the specialty __init__.py files
- Add imports to `/app/models/scores/{specialty}/__init__.py`
- Add router to `/app/routers/scores/{specialty}/__init__.py`

### 6. Reload the scores
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/reload
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual test with curl:

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# List scores
curl http://localhost:8000/api/scores

# Calculate CKD-EPI 2021 (Live API)
curl -X POST https://calculator.nobra.app.br/ckd_epi_2021 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"sex": "female", "age": 65, "serum_creatinine": 1.2}'

# Calculate CKD-EPI 2021 (Local)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ckd_epi_2021 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"sex": "female", "age": 65, "serum_creatinine": 1.2}'
```

## 🔌 MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration

### About MCP
The Nobra Calculator API includes built-in MCP server support, allowing AI assistants and other MCP-compatible clients to interact with all medical calculators as native tools.

### Connecting to MCP
- **MCP Endpoint**: `https://calculator.nobra.app.br/mcp`
- **Protocol**: Connect via URL using the MCP client of your choice
- **Authentication**: Same as the main API (rate limits apply)

### Important Considerations
⚠️ **WARNING**: The MCP server exposes **over 300 medical calculator tools**. When connecting:
- **Select specific tools** you need in your MCP client interface
- **Avoid loading all tools** at once - this will exceed most LLM context windows
- **Use tool filtering** to choose only the medical specialties or specific calculators relevant to your use case

### Example Tool Categories
- Cardiology scores (CHA2DS2-VASc, HAS-BLED, etc.)
- Nephrology calculators (CKD-EPI, MDRD, etc.)
- Pulmonology tools (CURB-65, PSI, etc.)
- Emergency medicine scores
- And many more across 15+ medical specialties

### MCP Client Configuration
When configuring your MCP client, consider:
1. Setting up tool filters by specialty or score name
2. Implementing pagination or lazy loading for tool discovery
3. Caching frequently used calculator tools
4. Managing context window usage efficiently

For more information about MCP integration, refer to the [MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).

## ⚠️ Medical Disclaimer

**IMPORTANT**: This API is intended for educational and research purposes only. It should not be used as a substitute for professional clinical judgment. All medical calculations should be verified independently, and clinical decisions should always involve qualified healthcare professionals.

- Always validate results with original references
- Consider patient-specific factors not captured in scores
- Use as a supplement to, not replacement for, clinical expertise
- Verify calculations independently for critical decisions
