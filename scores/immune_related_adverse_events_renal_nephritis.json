  "description": "Grades severity of nephritis secondary to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICPi) therapy based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0 criteria. This standardized grading system evaluates serum creatinine levels, renal function changes, and clinical symptoms to determine the severity of immune-mediated nephritis and guide clinical management decisions including ICPi therapy continuation, corticosteroid treatment, nephrology consultation needs, and monitoring for life-threatening renal complications. ICPi-induced nephritis has an incidence of 1-2% in single-agent therapy and 4.5% in combination therapy, with median onset at 14 weeks (range 6.5-21 weeks). The calculator provides evidence-based management recommendations essential for oncologists, nephrologists, and multidisciplinary teams managing patients on immunotherapy.",
