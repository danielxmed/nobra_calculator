  "title": "International IgA Nephropathy Prediction Tool",
  "description": "Predicts risk of 50% decline in eGFR or end-stage kidney disease in patients with IgA nephropathy. This validated prediction tool was developed using an international multi-ethnic cohort of 2,781 patients with biopsy-proven idiopathic IgA nephropathy. The tool uses clinical, laboratory, and histological parameters available at biopsy to provide risk estimates for kidney function decline. Two versions are available: one including race/ethnicity and one without race. The tool is endorsed by the 2021 KDIGO guidelines as the preferred method to predict kidney outcomes in IgA nephropathy patients. It facilitates clinical decision-making, patient counseling, and clinical trial enrollment by stratifying patients based on their risk of progressive kidney disease.",
