Consider routine follow-up, symptom monitoring, and cardiovascular risk factor modification as appropriate."

These patients warrant consideration for urgent evaluation or inpatient admission for further cardiac assessment. This includes ECG, cardiac biomarkers, and possible stress testing or coronary imaging. The modest positive predictive value emphasizes the need for comprehensive evaluation rather than assumption of CAD presence."
