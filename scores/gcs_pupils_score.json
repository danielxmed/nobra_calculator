  "description": "The GCS-Pupils Score (GCS-P) combines the Glasgow Coma Scale with pupillary reactivity assessment to provide enhanced prognostic accuracy in traumatic brain injury patients. This extended index offers improved prediction of 6-month mortality and unfavorable outcomes, particularly in patients with severe brain injury where standard GCS may be limited.",
