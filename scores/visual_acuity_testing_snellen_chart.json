  "description": "Assesses binocular and monocular visual acuity using standardized Snellen optotypes. This test evaluates the clarity of vision by determining the smallest line of letters a patient can accurately read on a standardized chart at a specific distance. Visual acuity testing is a fundamental component of ophthalmologic and neurologic examinations, particularly for cranial nerve II (optic nerve) assessment.",
