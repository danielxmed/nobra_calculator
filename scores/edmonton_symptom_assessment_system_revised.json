  "notes": [
    "The ESAS-r is a revision of the original Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) with improved clarity and definitions.",
    "All symptoms are assessed for the current moment ('right now') rather than over a time period.",
    "The revised version provides specific definitions for potentially confusing items like tiredness, drowsiness, depression, anxiety, and wellbeing.",
    "Symptoms are organized with physical symptoms first (pain, tiredness, drowsiness, nausea, lack of appetite, shortness of breath) followed by psychosocial symptoms (depression, anxiety) and overall wellbeing last.",
    "The tool has been validated in multiple languages and clinical settings for palliative care patients.",
    "Individual symptom scores of â‰¥4 are often considered clinically significant and warrant intervention.",
    "The tool should be used for longitudinal monitoring, with clinicians expecting to see a downward trend in scores with effective treatment.",
    "Can be administered by patients themselves (self-report) or with assistance from healthcare providers.",
    "Useful for symptom screening, monitoring treatment response, and communication between patients and healthcare teams.",
    "The ESAS-r is widely used in palliative care, oncology, nephrology, and other specialty settings.",
    "Regular reassessment is recommended to track changes in symptom burden over time.",
    "The tool helps identify which specific symptoms need more targeted intervention.",
    "Total scores provide an overall assessment of symptom burden, while individual scores guide specific symptom management.",
    "The revised version has been shown to be easier to understand and preferred by patients compared to the original ESAS.",
    "Healthcare providers have highly favorable opinions of the ESAS-r as a clinical practice tool."
