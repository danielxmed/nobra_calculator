  "description": "Aids in determining if Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir boosted with ritonavir) is appropriate therapy in an adult COVID-19 positive patient. Paxlovid is an oral antiviral treatment authorized for mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in patients at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. The tool evaluates eligibility based on FDA guidelines including age, weight, symptom duration, disease severity, kidney function, high-risk conditions, and potential contraindications. Proper patient selection is crucial as the medication must be started within 5 days of symptom onset and has significant drug interactions requiring careful evaluation. The assessment helps clinicians systematically determine appropriate candidates for this time-sensitive antiviral therapy.",
