  "description": "The Canadian C-Spine Rule is a clinical decision tool that helps determine whether cervical spine imaging can be safely avoided in alert and stable trauma patients. It uses high-risk factors, low-risk factors, and range of motion assessment to rule out clinically significant cervical spine injury (CSI) with 100% sensitivity.",
