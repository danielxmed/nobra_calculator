  "title": "IMPACT Score for Outcomes in Head Injury",
  "description": "Predicts 6-month mortality and unfavorable outcomes after moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). The International Mission on Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials (IMPACT) score uses three progressive models (Core, Extended, Lab) to provide evidence-based prognosis in patients with GCS ≤12. Developed from a database of 8,509 acute TBI patients from 8 randomized controlled trials and 3 observational studies. This validated prognostic tool assists clinicians in counseling families, making treatment decisions, and planning care for severe TBI patients. The Core model uses only clinical variables (age, motor score, pupillary reactivity), while Extended adds CT findings and Lab incorporates laboratory values for enhanced accuracy.",
