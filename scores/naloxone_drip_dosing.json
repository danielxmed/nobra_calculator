  "interpretation": {
    "general": "Start continuous IV infusion at calculated rate. Administer half of the bolus dose 15 minutes after starting drip. Titrate based on respiratory rate, hypoxia, and CNS depression. Decrease rate if withdrawal symptoms occur.",
    "monitoring": "Requires intensive care monitoring. Naloxone half-life (30-100 minutes) is shorter than most opioids, necessitating continuous infusion for sustained reversal."
