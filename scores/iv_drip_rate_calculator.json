  "title": "IV Drip Rate Calculator",
  "description": "Calculates IV infusion rate using drip count when IV pumps are unavailable. This tool determines the correct drops per minute needed to deliver a specified volume of intravenous fluid over a given time period using gravity-fed IV administration sets. Essential for resource-limited settings or when electronic infusion pumps are not available.",
