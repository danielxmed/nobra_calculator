  "title": "Canadian CT Head Injury/Trauma Rule",
  "description": "The Canadian CT Head Rule is a clinical decision tool that helps determine which patients with minor head injury require CT head imaging. It uses high-risk and medium-risk criteria to identify patients who may have injuries requiring neurosurgical intervention or admission. The rule is 100% sensitive for detecting neurosurgical lesions and can reduce unnecessary CT scans by approximately 30%.",
