    "The ONLS is a modified version of the Overall Disability Sum Score (ODSS) with better content validity and reduced ceiling effect",

    "High inter-rater reliability with intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.97",
    "Acceptable responsiveness with standardized response mean of 0.76",
    "Best used with direct patient observation rather than patient self-reporting",
    "Not validated for use in pediatric populations",
    "Particularly useful for tracking progression in immune-mediated polyneuropathies",
    "The legs scale includes running and stair climbing to reduce ceiling effects compared to ODSS",
    "Should be used in conjunction with other neuropathy assessment tools for comprehensive evaluation",
    "Scores of 0-3 generally indicate preserved independence in daily activities",
    "Scores â‰¥7 typically indicate need for mobility aids or assistance",
