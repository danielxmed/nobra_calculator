    Calculates Kidney Failure Risk using 4-Variable KFRE
    
    The Kidney Failure Risk Equation is the gold standard for predicting 
    progression to kidney failure in CKD patients. It outperforms clinical 
    judgment and other risk equations.
    
    Input Parameters:
    - Age: 18-110 years
    - Sex: Male/female (males have slightly higher risk)
    - eGFR: 1-60 mL/min/1.73 mÂ² (CKD stages 3-5)
    - Urine ACR: 0.1-25,000 mg/g (higher = worse prognosis)
    - Region: For appropriate calibration
    
    Risk Categories and Clinical Actions:
    - Low (<5% at 5 years): Primary care management often appropriate
    - Intermediate (5-15%): Consider nephrology referral
    - High (15-30%): Nephrology referral recommended, begin RRT planning
    - Very High (>30%): Urgent referral, immediate RRT preparation
    
    Clinical Applications:
    - Nephrology referral triage
    - Dialysis access timing (typically when 2-year risk >20%)
    - Transplant evaluation planning
    - Patient education and counseling
    - Resource allocation
    
    Validation:
    - C-statistic: 0.83-0.92 for 2-year prediction
    - Validated in >700,000 patients globally
    - Superior to eGFR alone or clinical judgment
