    Calculates 4-Level Pulmonary Embolism Clinical Probability Score (4PEPS)
    
    The 4PEPS uses 13 clinical variables to stratify patients with suspected 
    pulmonary embolism into four probability categories:
    
    - Very Low (<0 points): PE ruled out, no testing needed
    - Low (0-5 points): Use D-dimer with 1000 Î¼g/L cut-off  
    - Moderate (6-12 points): Use age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off
    - High (>12 points): Proceed directly to imaging
    
    This score can safely reduce imaging studies in 58% of patients with 
    suspected PE while maintaining a low failure rate of 1.3%.
