    Calculates CAROC System for fracture risk assessment
    
    The Canadian Association of Radiologists and Osteoporosis Canada (CAROC) 
    System provides a simplified approach to assess 10-year absolute fracture 
    risk for major osteoporotic fractures. It stratifies patients into low 
    (<10%), moderate (10-20%), or high (>20%) risk categories.
    
    Key features:
    - Based on age, sex, and femoral neck T-score
    - Two major clinical risk factors: fragility fracture and glucocorticoid use
    - Does not require computer access (paper-based tables available)
    - High concordance (88-89%) with Canadian FRAX tool
    
    Risk elevation rules:
    - T-score â‰¤-2.5 at any site = at least moderate risk
    - Either risk factor elevates risk by one category
    - Both risk factors = automatic high risk
    
    The tool is primarily validated for Canadian populations aged 50-85 years
    and may not generalize to other ethnic groups.
