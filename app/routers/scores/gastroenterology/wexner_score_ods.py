    Calculates Wexner Score for Obstructed Defecation Syndrome (ODS)
    
    The Wexner Score is the most widely used and validated scoring system for assessing 
    fecal incontinence severity. It evaluates five parameters (solid stool incontinence, 
    liquid stool incontinence, gas incontinence, protective pad use, and lifestyle impact) 
    using a standardized frequency scale.
    
    Clinical Applications:
    - Assessment of fecal incontinence severity
    - Treatment planning and monitoring
    - Quality of life impact evaluation
    - Research and clinical trials
    
    Interpretation:
    - 0 points: Perfect continence (no treatment needed)
    - 1-9 points: Mild incontinence (conservative management)
    - 10-20 points: Clinical incontinence (requires active management)
    
    Args:
        request: Parameters including frequency scores for each incontinence aspect
        
    Returns:
        WexnerScoreOdsResponse: Result with clinical interpretation and management recommendations
