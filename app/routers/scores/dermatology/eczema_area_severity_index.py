    Calculates Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI)
    
    The EASI is the most validated and widely used assessment tool for atopic dermatitis 
    severity in clinical practice and research. It evaluates eczema severity across four 
    body regions (head/neck, upper extremities, trunk, lower extremities) by assessing 
    both area involvement (0-6 scale) and four severity signs (0-3 scale each): erythema, 
    edema/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification.
    
    Key Clinical Features:
    - Total score range: 0-72 points
    - Assessment time: ~6 minutes by trained investigator
    - Validated severity categories with treatment recommendations
    - Substantial inter-rater reliability (Îº = 0.75)
    - Correlates with patient-reported outcomes (pruritus, sleep, QoL)
    - Recommended primary endpoint for clinical trials
    
    Age-Based Regional Multipliers:
    - Children (0-7 years): Head/neck=0.2, Upper extremities=0.2, Trunk=0.3, Lower extremities=0.4
    - Adults (8+ years): Head/neck=0.1, Upper extremities=0.2, Trunk=0.3, Lower extremities=0.4
    
    Assessment Considerations:
    - Perform in good lighting for accurate erythema assessment
    - Consider skin pigmentation when grading erythema (may need higher score in darker skin)
    - Complete independently of previous assessments (static tool)
    - Does not assess dryness/scaling (limitation of tool)
    
    Args:
        request: Parameters for all body regions including area involvement and severity signs
        
    Returns:
        EczemaAreaSeverityIndexResponse: EASI score with severity category and treatment recommendations
