    Calculates Behavioral Activity Rating Scale (BARS)
    
    The BARS is a validated 7-point observational scale used to assess behavioral activity 
    and agitation in patients in emergency care and psychiatric settings.
    
    **Scale Overview:**
    - **1**: Difficult or unable to arouse (hypoactive)
    - **2**: Asleep but responds normally to verbal or physical contact
    - **3**: Drowsy, appears sedated
    - **4**: Quiet and awake (normal level of activity) - *Therapeutic target*
    - **5**: Signs of over activity; calms down with instructions (mild agitation)
    - **6**: Extremely or continuously active; does not require restraint (moderate agitation)
    - **7**: Violent behavior requiring restraint (severe agitation)
    
    **Clinical Features:**
    - **Observational tool**: Does not require patient participation or verbal responses
    - **Rapid assessment**: Can be completed in seconds to minutes
    - **High reliability**: Excellent inter-rater and intra-rater reliability demonstrated
    - **Multi-disciplinary**: Can be used by nurses, physicians, and other healthcare staff
    - **Emergency-focused**: Designed for acute care settings where rapid assessment is critical
    
    **Clinical Thresholds:**
    - **Scores â‰¤4**: Generally indicate stable or controlled behavior
    - **Scores >4**: Typically warrant clinical evaluation and possible intervention
    - **Score 7**: Requires immediate emergency intervention and safety protocols
    
    **Applications:**
    - Emergency department triage and monitoring
    - Psychiatric inpatient unit assessments
    - Medication response evaluation
    - De-escalation effectiveness monitoring
    - Research studies on agitation interventions
    
    **Validation:**
    The BARS was validated in multiple studies showing moderate correlation with other 
    agitation measures (PANSS agitation items, CGI-S) and virtually perfect inter- and 
    intra-rater reliability. It demonstrates superior treatment effect size compared to 
    other agitation rating scales.
