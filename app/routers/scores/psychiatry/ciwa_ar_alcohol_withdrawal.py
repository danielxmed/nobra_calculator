    Calculates CIWA-Ar for Alcohol Withdrawal Assessment
    
    The Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol, Revised (CIWA-Ar) is a 
    validated 10-component assessment tool that quantifies alcohol withdrawal severity 
    and guides evidence-based treatment decisions. This scale takes less than 5 minutes 
    to complete and should be performed every 1-2 hours during active withdrawal management.
    
    The assessment evaluates:
    - Nausea and vomiting (0-7 points)
    - Tremor (0-7 points) 
    - Paroxysmal sweats (0-7 points)
    - Anxiety (0-7 points)
    - Agitation (0-7 points)
    - Tactile disturbances (0-7 points)
    - Auditory disturbances (0-7 points)
    - Visual disturbances (0-7 points)
    - Headache and fullness in head (0-7 points)
    - Orientation and clouding of sensorium (0-4 points)
    
    Total scores range from 0-67 points with three severity categories:
    - Minimal (0-8): Usually no treatment required
    - Mild to Moderate (9-19): Consider benzodiazepines
    - Severe (â‰¥20): Aggressive treatment required, high risk for delirium tremens
