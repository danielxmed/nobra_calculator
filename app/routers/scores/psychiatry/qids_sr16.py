    Calculates Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-SR-16) Score
    
    The QIDS-SR-16 is a validated self-report instrument that comprehensively assesses 
    depressive symptom severity over the past 7 days using 16 items covering all nine 
    DSM-IV depression criterion symptom domains. This efficient yet comprehensive tool 
    provides reliable assessment for screening, treatment monitoring, and research 
    applications in mental health care.
    
    Clinical Applications:
    - Depression screening in primary care and specialty settings
    - Treatment response monitoring and outcome measurement
    - Clinical trial endpoints and research applications
    - Treatment planning and adjustment guidance
    - Quality improvement initiatives in mental health care
    
    Special Scoring Features:
    - Sleep domain: Highest score among 4 sleep items prevents over-weighting
    - Appetite/weight domain: Highest score among 4 appetite/weight items
    - Psychomotor domain: Highest score between agitation and retardation
    - Total possible score: 0-27 points with evidence-based severity thresholds
    
    Safety Considerations:
    - Suicidal ideation scores â‰¥2 require immediate safety evaluation
    - Comprehensive risk assessment protocols for high-risk patients
    - Integration with clinical interview and safety planning
    
    Args:
