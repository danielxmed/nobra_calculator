    Evaluates DSM-5 Criteria for Bipolar Disorder
    
    The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for Bipolar Disorder evaluates episodes of mania or hypomania:
    
    Core Criteria (both must be present):
    A. Elevated, expansive, or irritable mood, present most of the day, nearly every day
    B. Abnormally and persistently increased goal-directed activity or energy
    
    Additional Symptoms (at least 3 of 7 required):
    1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity
    2. Decreased need for sleep (feels rested after only 3 hours)
    3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking
    4. Flight of ideas or racing thoughts
    5. Distractibility (attention easily drawn to unimportant stimuli)
    6. Increase in goal-directed activity or psychomotor agitation
    7. Excessive involvement in risky activities with high potential for consequences
    
    Duration and Impairment Requirements:
    - Manic Episode: â‰¥7 days duration (or hospitalization required) + marked impairment
    - Hypomanic Episode: 4-6 days duration + observable change but less impairment
    
    Bipolar Disorder Types:
    - Bipolar I: At least one manic episode (lifetime)
    - Bipolar II: At least one hypomanic episode + at least one major depressive episode
    
    Key DSM-5 Changes:
    - Added "increased activity/energy" as core requirement alongside mood symptoms
    - This addition reduced prevalence estimates by approximately 48%
    - Mixed features specifier can be applied to any mood episode
    
    Important Clinical Considerations:
    - This is a diagnostic aid for clinical evaluation, not a substitute for assessment
    - Risk assessment for suicide and psychotic features is essential
    - Consider hospitalization for manic episodes with significant impairment
    - Comprehensive psychiatric evaluation required for definitive diagnosis
