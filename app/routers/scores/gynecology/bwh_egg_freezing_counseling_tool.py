    Calculates BWH Egg Freezing Counseling Tool (EFCT)
    
    Predicts likelihood of live birth for elective egg freezing in women based on age 
    and number of mature eggs retrieved. This evidence-based tool was developed at 
    Brigham and Women's Hospital to help counsel women considering elective egg freezing.
    
    The calculator provides probabilities for achieving:
    - At least one live birth
    - At least two live births  
    - At least three live births
    
    Key factors:
    - Age: Women's age at time of egg freezing (24-44 years)
    - Number of mature eggs: Total mature (MII) oocytes retrieved and frozen (1-100)
    
    The model accounts for:
    - Age-specific blastocyst formation rates
    - Age-specific rates of chromosomally normal (euploid) embryos
    - Live birth rate per euploid blastocyst (~60%)
    
    Important notes:
    - Designed for elective egg freezing in healthy women
    - May overestimate rates for medical egg freezing (e.g., cancer patients)
    - Less reliable for women â‰¥39 years due to limited data
    - Assumes standard vitrification techniques and experienced laboratory
    - Results are probabilities for counseling, not guarantees
