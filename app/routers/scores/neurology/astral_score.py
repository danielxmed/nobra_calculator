    Calculates ASTRAL Score for Ischemic Stroke
    
    Predicts 90-day poor outcome (mRS >2) in patients with acute ischemic stroke.
    The ASTRAL score combines age, NIHSS score, time from onset to admission, 
    visual field defects, glucose abnormalities, and consciousness level to 
    stratify prognosis.
    
    **Clinical Use:**
    - Use only in patients admitted within 24 hours of stroke onset
    - Score should only be used for patients with pre-stroke independence (mRS 0-2)
    - Poor outcome defined as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) >2 at 90 days
    - Use in conjunction with clinical judgment, not as sole decision-making tool
    
    **Score Interpretation:**
    - 0-15 points: Low risk (better prognosis for functional independence)
    - 16-25 points: Moderate risk (requires careful monitoring and rehabilitation)
    - â‰¥26 points: High risk (significant disability/death risk, consider palliative care)
