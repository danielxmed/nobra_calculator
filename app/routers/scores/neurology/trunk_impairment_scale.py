    Calculates Trunk Impairment Scale
    
    The Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS) is a clinical assessment tool that quantifies trunk motor 
    impairment after stroke and has been validated in Parkinson's disease. It evaluates trunk 
    function through 17 specific items across three domains:
    
    - Static sitting balance (3 items): Basic sitting position maintenance, therapist-assisted 
      leg crossing, and patient-performed leg crossing (0-7 points)
    - Dynamic sitting balance (10 items): Elbow movements and pelvis lifts with assessments 
      of shortening/lengthening and compensation patterns (0-10 points)  
    - Coordination (4 items): Upper and lower trunk rotation movements with speed assessment 
      (0-6 points)
    
    The assessment requires specific positioning: patient sits on edge of bed/table without 
    back or arm support, thighs fully in contact with surface, knees bent at 90Â°, feet 
    hip-width apart and flat on floor, arms resting on legs, head and trunk in midline position.
    
    Scores range from 0-23 points with established cut-off values for impairment classification. 
    The tool includes dependency rules where failing certain items automatically results in 
    zero scores for related follow-up assessments.
