    Calculates G8 Geriatric Screening Tool
    
    Identifies older cancer patients who could benefit from comprehensive geriatric 
    assessment (CGA). The G8 is a validated 8-item screening questionnaire that evaluates 
    multiple geriatric domains including nutrition, mobility, cognition, and functional 
    status to determine which elderly cancer patients require full geriatric evaluation.
    
    The tool incorporates 7 items from the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) plus patient 
    age to create a comprehensive screening instrument suitable for routine use in oncology 
    settings. A score â‰¤14 points indicates high risk for geriatric impairment and 
    recommends comprehensive geriatric assessment.
