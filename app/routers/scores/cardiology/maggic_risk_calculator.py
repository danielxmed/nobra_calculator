    Calculates MAGGIC Risk Score for Heart Failure mortality prediction and management guidance
    
    The MAGGIC risk calculator is a validated prognostic tool that provides accurate mortality
    estimates and helps guide clinical decision-making in heart failure patients.
    
    Key Features:
    - Estimates 1-year and 3-year mortality risk
    - Applicable to both HFrEF (EF â‰¤40%) and HFpEF (EF >40%) patients
    - Uses 13 readily available clinical variables
    - Extensively validated across diverse populations
    - C-index of 0.70-0.75 for mortality prediction
    
    Clinical Applications:
    - Prognosis discussions with patients and families
    - Risk stratification for clinical decision-making
    - Intensity of medical therapy and monitoring
    - Referral timing to advanced heart failure specialists
    - Device therapy evaluation (ICD/CRT) consideration
    - Advanced therapy assessment (transplant, mechanical support)
    - End-of-life care planning when appropriate
    - Clinical trial enrollment and research applications
    
    Risk Categories:
    - Low Risk (0-15 points): 1-year <5%, 3-year <15% mortality
      Standard heart failure management with evidence-based therapy
    - Intermediate Risk (16-25 points): 1-year 5-15%, 3-year 15-40% mortality
      Optimized medical therapy and closer monitoring recommended
    - High Risk (26-35 points): 1-year 15-40%, 3-year 40-70% mortality
      Advanced therapies and specialist referral may be indicated
    - Very High Risk (>35 points): 1-year >40%, 3-year >70% mortality
      Urgent advanced heart failure evaluation recommended
    
    Scoring Components:
    1. Age (varies by EF category): Higher age increases risk, especially in HFpEF
    2. Male gender: +1 point additional risk
    3. Ejection fraction: Lower EF associated with higher mortality
    4. NYHA class: Worse functional capacity increases risk significantly
    5. Creatinine: Kidney dysfunction strongly predicts mortality
    6. Systolic BP: Lower BP associated with worse prognosis
    7. BMI: Obesity paradox - higher BMI is protective in heart failure
    8. Diabetes: +3 points - significant mortality predictor
    9. COPD: +2 points - comorbidity burden
    10. Current smoking: +1 point - ongoing cardiovascular risk
    11. HF duration >18 months: +2 points - established disease
    12. No beta-blocker: +3 points - lack of evidence-based therapy
    13. No ACE-I/ARB: +1 point - suboptimal medical therapy
    
    Validation and Performance:
    - Developed from 39,372 patients from 30 international studies
    - Validated in Swedish Heart Failure Registry (51,043 patients)
    - Used in major clinical trials (PARADIGM-HF, EMPHASIS-HF)
    - Available online calculator at www.heartfailurerisk.org
    - Mortality estimates: 1-year ranges from 1.5% (score 0) to 84.2% (score 50+)
    - 3-year mortality: ranges from 3.9% (score 0) to 98.5% (score 50+)
    
    Limitations:
    - Does not include biomarkers (BNP/NT-proBNP)
    - Developed before newer therapies (SGLT2 inhibitors, ENTRESTO)
    - May underestimate risk in some contemporary populations
    - Should be used in conjunction with clinical judgment
