This systematic diagnostic framework uses morphological, immunophenotypic, and molecular criteria to diagnose mast cell disorders with enhanced specificity compared to previous WHO criteria. The ICC diagnostic algorithm requires either the major criterion (multifocal dense mast cell infiltrates â‰¥15 cells in aggregates in bone marrow or extracutaneous organs) OR at least 3 minor criteria (atypical mast cell morphology >25%, aberrant immunophenotype with CD25/CD2/CD30 expression, KIT mutation detection, elevated serum tryptase >20 ng/mL). The diagnosis facilitates appropriate subtype classification into indolent SM, smoldering SM, aggressive SM, mast cell leukemia, or SM with associated myeloid neoplasm, enabling targeted therapeutic approaches. This tool is particularly valuable for hematologists, pathologists, and oncologists in establishing accurate diagnoses and determining optimal management strategies for patients with suspected systemic mastocytosis.",
