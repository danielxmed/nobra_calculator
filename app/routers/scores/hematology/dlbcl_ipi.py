    description="Calculates the International Prognostic Index (IPI) for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) to predict overall survival and stratify patients into risk groups. This validated prognostic model uses five independent risk factors (age >60 years, elevated LDH, advanced Ann Arbor stage III-IV, ECOG performance status â‰¥2, and >1 extranodal site) to calculate a score from 0-5 points. The original IPI identifies four risk groups with 5-year overall survival rates: Low Risk (0-1 points, ~73% OS), Low-Intermediate Risk (2 points, ~51% OS), High-Intermediate Risk (3 points, ~43% OS), and High Risk (4-5 points, ~26% OS). The Revised IPI (R-IPI) redistributes patients into three groups for better discrimination in the rituximab era: Very Good (0-1 points, 4-year PFS/OS 94%), Good (2 points, intermediate outcomes), and Poor (3-5 points, lowest survival rates). This prognostic tool enables risk-adapted treatment planning, clinical trial stratification, and patient counseling. High-risk patients should be considered for intensified treatment approaches, clinical trial enrollment, or novel therapeutic strategies, while low-risk patients may be candidates for standard R-CHOP therapy or less intensive approaches in clinical trials.",
