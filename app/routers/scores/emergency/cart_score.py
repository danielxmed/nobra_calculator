    Calculates CART (Cardiac Arrest Risk Triage) Score
    
    Predicts the risk of in-hospital cardiac arrest within 48 hours using vital signs 
    and age. The CART score was developed to identify hospitalized patients at high 
    risk for cardiac arrest who may benefit from intensive monitoring or early intervention.
    
    The score uses four parameters:
    - Respiratory Rate: <21 (0 pts), 21-23 (8 pts), 24-25 (12 pts), 26-29 (15 pts), >29 (22 pts)
    - Heart Rate: <110 (0 pts), 110-139 (4 pts), >139 (13 pts)  
    - Diastolic Blood Pressure: >49 (0 pts), 40-49 (4 pts), 35-39 (6 pts), <35 (13 pts)
    - Age: <55 (0 pts), 55-69 (4 pts), >69 (9 pts)
    
    Risk interpretation:
    - Score â‰¤20: Low risk of cardiac arrest within 48 hours
    - Score >20: High risk (consider intensive monitoring, rapid response team activation)
    
    The CART score has 91.9% specificity for predicting cardiac arrest within 48 hours
    and outperformed MEWS in validation studies.
