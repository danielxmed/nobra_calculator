    Calculates GO-FAR (Good Outcome Following Attempted Resuscitation) Score
    
    The GO-FAR score is an evidence-based tool that predicts survival to discharge 
    with good neurological outcome after in-hospital cardiac arrest. It uses 13 
    pre-arrest clinical variables to stratify patients into risk categories, 
    enabling healthcare providers to have informed discussions with patients and 
    families about resuscitation preferences and code status decisions.
    
    **Clinical Applications**:
    - Shared decision-making regarding resuscitation preferences
    - Risk stratification for in-hospital cardiac arrest outcomes
    - Code status discussions with evidence-based framework
    - Quality improvement in critical care resource allocation
    - Family counseling with realistic outcome expectations
    
    **Scoring System**:
    The score uses 13 weighted variables ranging from -15 to +11 points:
    - Age categories (0-11 points)
    - Neurologically intact at admission (-15 points if yes - protective factor)
    - Major trauma (+10 points if yes)
    - Acute stroke (+8 points if yes)
    - Metastatic/hematologic cancer (+7 points if yes)
    - Septicemia (+7 points if yes)
    - Medical non-cardiac diagnosis (+7 points if yes)
    - Hepatic insufficiency (+6 points if yes)
    - Skilled nursing facility admission (+6 points if yes)
    - Hypotension/hypoperfusion (+5 points if yes)
    - Renal insufficiency/dialysis (+4 points if yes)
    - Respiratory insufficiency (+4 points if yes)
    - Pneumonia (+1 point if yes)
    
    **Survival Probability Categories**:
    - Above Average (-15 to -6 points): >15% probability
    - Average (-5 to 13 points): 3-15% probability
    - Low (14 to 23 points): 1-3% probability  
    - Very Low (â‰¥24 points): <1% probability
    
    **Important Notes**:
    - Developed specifically for in-hospital cardiac arrests
    - Should be used as part of comprehensive clinical assessment
    - Supports shared decision-making, not mandated care decisions
    - Consider patient autonomy, cultural factors, and individual circumstances
    - Neurologically intact survival defined as CPC score of 1 at discharge
