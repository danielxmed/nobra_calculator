    Calculates Gail Model for Breast Cancer Risk
    
    Estimates risk for breast cancer based on demographic and clinical data. The Gail Model 
    calculates a woman's absolute risk of developing invasive breast cancer over the next 
    5 years using personal medical and reproductive history and family history of breast 
    cancer among first-degree relatives.
    
    The model uses 7 key risk factors: age, race/ethnicity, age at menarche, age at first 
    live birth, family history, breast biopsy history, and atypical hyperplasia. A 5-year 
    risk â‰¥1.67% meets the FDA threshold for chemoprevention consideration.
    
    Valid for women aged 35-85 years without personal history of breast cancer. The model 
    has been validated for White, African-American, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander 
    women in the United States.

        request: Parameters needed for Gail Model calculation including demographic data,
