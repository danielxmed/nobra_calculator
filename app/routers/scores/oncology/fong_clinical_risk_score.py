    Calculates Fong Clinical Risk Score for Colorectal Cancer Recurrence
    
    The Fong Clinical Risk Score predicts recurrence and survival risk for colorectal cancer 
    patients with liver metastases after hepatic resection. Developed from analysis of 1,001 
    consecutive cases at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.
    
    **Clinical Parameters (1 point each):**
    - Node-positive primary tumor (lymph node involvement)
    - Disease-free interval <12 months from primary to liver metastasis
    - Multiple (>1) liver metastases
    - Preoperative CEA level >200 ng/mL
    - Largest liver metastasis >5 cm
    
    **Score Range:** 0-5 points
    
    **Risk Stratification:**
    - Score 0-2: Favorable prognosis (5-year survival 30-60%)
    - Score 3-5: Poor prognosis (5-year survival 11-16%)
    
    **Clinical Applications:**
    - Risk stratification for surgical planning
    - Patient counseling regarding prognosis
    - Selection for adjuvant therapy trials
    - Postoperative surveillance planning
    
    **Treatment Implications:**
    - Patients with scores 0-2 are good candidates for hepatic resection
    - Patients with scores â‰¥3 should be considered for experimental adjuvant therapy
    - High scores may benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy before resection
