    Calculates Graded Prognostic Assessment for Gastrointestinal Cancer (GI-GPA)
    
    The GI-GPA is a validated prognostic tool specifically designed for patients with 
    gastrointestinal cancers who develop brain metastases. This scoring system provides 
    crucial information for treatment planning and prognostic discussions in a patient 
    population with historically challenging outcomes.
    
    **Clinical Background**:
    Brain metastases occur in 10-20% of patients with gastrointestinal cancers, representing 
    a devastating complication with median survival of approximately 8 months. However, 
    survival varies significantly based on patient and disease characteristics, making 
    prognostic stratification essential for optimal care.
    
    **Scoring System (4 Prognostic Factors)**:
    The GI-GPA uses four key prognostic factors, each contributing specific point values:
    
    **Age Categories**:
    - Under 60 years: 0.5 points (better prognosis)
    - 60 years or over: 0.0 points (standard reference)
    
    **Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS)**:
    - KPS <80: 0.0 points (poor functional status)
    - KPS 80: 1.0 point (moderate functional status)  
    - KPS 90-100: 2.0 points (excellent functional status)
    
    **Extracranial Metastases**:
    - Present: 0.0 points (advanced systemic disease)
    - Absent: 0.5 points (brain-only metastatic disease)
    
    **Number of Brain Metastases**:
    - >3 brain metastases: 0.0 points (extensive intracranial disease)
    - 2-3 brain metastases: 0.5 points (moderate intracranial disease)
    - 1 brain metastasis: 1.0 point (limited intracranial disease)
    
    **Survival Outcomes and Treatment Implications**:
    - **Poor Prognosis (0-1.0 points, 3 months)**: Focus on comfort care and symptom palliation
    - **Intermediate-Poor (1.5-2.0 points, 9 months)**: Consider limited interventions, palliative radiation
    - **Intermediate (2.5-3.0 points, 12 months)**: Consider radiation therapy, selective surgical intervention
    - **Good Prognosis (3.5-4.0 points, 17 months)**: Consider aggressive multimodal therapy, clinical trials
    
    **Key Clinical Applications**:
    - Treatment selection (aggressive multimodal therapy vs. palliative care)
    - Prognostic communication with evidence-based survival estimates
    - Clinical trial stratification for research studies
    - Resource allocation and appropriate level of care determination
    - Multidisciplinary treatment planning coordination
    
    **Important Clinical Considerations**:
    - Developed from multi-institutional cohort of 845 patients with GI cancers and brain metastases
    - Applicable to various GI cancer types (colorectal, gastric, esophageal, hepatobiliary)
    - Score ranges from 0.0 (worst prognosis) to 4.0 (best prognosis)
    - Over 30% of patients present in the worst prognostic group (GI-GPA â‰¤1.0)
    - Should complement, not replace, clinical judgment and patient preferences
