    Calculates Gleason Score for Prostate Cancer
    
    The Gleason Score is the most widely used histologic grading system for prostate cancer, 
    developed by Dr. Donald Gleason in the 1960s and modified by the International Society 
    of Urological Pathology (ISUP) in 2014. It evaluates the microscopic architecture of 
    prostate cancer cells based on how closely they resemble normal prostate tissue.
    
    The scoring system combines two grades representing the most prevalent tumor patterns:
    - Primary Grade (3-5): Most predominant pattern (>50% of tumor)
    - Secondary Grade (3-5): Second most common pattern (â‰¥5% but <50%)
    
    Total scores range from 6-10, corresponding to ISUP Grade Groups 1-5, which guide 
    prognosis and treatment decisions. The distinction between 3+4=7 and 4+3=7 is 
    clinically significant for risk stratification.

        GleasonScoreProstateResponse: Total Gleason score with grade group, prognosis, and treatment recommendations
