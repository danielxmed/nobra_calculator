    Calculates maintenance fluid requirements using the Holliday-Segar method
    
    The Holliday-Segar method is the gold standard for calculating maintenance fluid requirements
    in both pediatric and adult patients, providing evidence-based fluid management guidance.
    
    Historical Background:
    Developed by Malcolm Holliday and William Segar in 1957, this method revolutionized
    pediatric fluid management by establishing a systematic, weight-based approach to
    maintenance fluid calculation. The formula is based on metabolic water needs and
    has been validated across different age groups and clinical conditions.
    
    Clinical Applications:
    - Maintenance IV fluid calculation for hospitalized patients
    - Post-operative fluid management and recovery
    - NPO (nothing by mouth) patients requiring IV hydration
    - Baseline calculation for adjusting additional fluid needs
    - Emergency department fluid resuscitation planning
    - ICU fluid management protocols
    - Pediatric and adult ward fluid orders
    
    Formula Breakdown:
    Weight Category 1 (0-10 kg): 100 mL/kg/day
    - Based on high metabolic rate in small children
    - Accounts for higher surface area to weight ratio
    - Examples: 5 kg infant = 500 mL/day, 8 kg toddler = 800 mL/day
    
    Weight Category 2 (10-20 kg): 1000 mL + 50 mL/kg for each kg over 10
    - Recognizes decreased metabolic rate per kg as size increases
    - Examples: 12 kg child = 1100 mL/day, 18 kg child = 1400 mL/day
    
    Weight Category 3 (>20 kg): 1500 mL + 20 mL/kg for each kg over 20
    - Further reduced rate for larger patients
    - Examples: 25 kg child = 1600 mL/day, 70 kg adult = 2500 mL/day
    
    Clinical Considerations:
    
    Fluid Type Selection:
    - Isotonic solutions preferred (0.9% NaCl, Lactated Ringer's)
    - Hypotonic solutions may cause hyponatremia
    - Consider electrolyte content based on patient needs
    
    Adjustments Required For:
    - Fever: Increase 10-15% for each degree Celsius >37Â°C
    - Ongoing losses: Diarrhea, vomiting, drainage, diuresis
    - Clinical conditions: Heart failure, renal disease, liver disease
    - Environmental factors: High ambient temperature, low humidity
    
    Monitoring Parameters:
    - Urine output (goal: 1-2 mL/kg/hr)
    - Serum electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride)
    - Fluid balance (inputs vs outputs)
    - Clinical signs of hydration status
    - Daily weights for trend monitoring
    
    Special Populations:
    
    Neonates (<1 month):
    - May require different calculations
    - Higher insensible losses
    - Immature renal function considerations
    - Monitor closely for fluid overload
    
    Elderly Patients:
    - May need fluid restriction
    - Consider comorbidities (heart, kidney, liver disease)
    - Monitor for signs of fluid overload
    
    Critical Care Patients:
    - Formula provides starting point only
    - Adjust based on hemodynamic status
    - Consider capillary leak, third spacing
    - May need goal-directed fluid therapy
    
    Contraindications and Limitations:
    - Does not replace clinical judgment
    - Not suitable for fluid resuscitation
    - May not apply to severe renal/cardiac disease
    - Requires adjustment for ongoing losses
    - Should not be used as sole guide in critical illness
    
    Quality and Safety Measures:
    - Regular reassessment of fluid needs
    - Electrolyte monitoring protocols
    - Documentation of fluid balance
    - Recognition of fluid overload signs
    - Adjustment protocols for changing conditions
    
    Evidence Base:
    The Holliday-Segar method has been validated through decades of clinical use
    and remains the standard of care endorsed by pediatric and internal medicine
    organizations worldwide. Recent studies support the use of isotonic solutions
    to prevent hospital-acquired hyponatremia.
