    Request model for 6-Minute Walk Distance calculation
    
    The 6-minute walk test (6MWT) is a standardized exercise test that assesses functional
    capacity and cardiopulmonary fitness, providing reference values for comparison.
    
    **Clinical Use**:
    - Functional capacity assessment
    - Cardiopulmonary disease monitoring
    - Pre-operative risk stratification
    - Pulmonary rehabilitation outcomes
    - Heart failure assessment
    - Disability evaluation
    - Treatment response monitoring
    
    **Test Protocol**:
    - 30-meter flat corridor
    - Patient walks at own pace for 6 minutes
    - Encouragement every 2 minutes
    - Oxygen saturation and symptoms monitored
    - Distance measured in meters

    - >80% of predicted: Normal functional capacity

    - 40-60% of predicted: Moderate functional limitation

    - Distances <350m associated with increased mortality in heart failure
