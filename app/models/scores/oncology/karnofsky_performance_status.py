The Karnofsky Performance Status Scale is a widely used tool in oncology to assess a 
patient's functional status and ability to tolerate cancer treatments. Originally developed 
in 1949 by David Karnofsky and colleagues for nitrogen mustard chemotherapy studies, it 
provides an 11-point scale (0-100% in 10% increments) that correlates with treatment 
tolerance, survival outcomes, and quality of life measures in cancer patients.

The scale is particularly valuable for:
- Treatment eligibility assessment
- Clinical trial enrollment criteria
- Prognosis evaluation
- Treatment intensity decisions
- Quality of life assessment

Higher scores (80-100%) generally indicate good performance status suitable for aggressive 
treatments, while lower scores (0-40%) may indicate need for palliative care or less 
intensive treatments. The scale has been validated across multiple cancer types and 
remains a standard assessment tool in oncology practice.

    Request model for Karnofsky Performance Status Scale
    
    The Karnofsky Performance Status Scale uses a single assessment parameter to evaluate 
    functional status on an 11-point scale:
    
    Performance Status Levels:
    - 100%: Normal, no complaints, no evidence of disease
    - 90%: Able to carry on normal activity; minor signs or symptoms of disease  
    - 80%: Normal activity with some effort; some signs or symptoms of disease
    - 70%: Cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or active work
    - 60%: Requires occasional assistance but able to care for most personal needs
    - 50%: Requires considerable assistance and frequent medical care
    - 40%: Disabled; requires special care and assistance
    - 30%: Severely disabled; hospitalization indicated though death not imminent
    - 20%: Very sick; hospitalization necessary; active supportive treatment necessary
    - 10%: Moribund; fatal processes progressing rapidly
    - 0%: Death
    
    Clinical Interpretation:
    - 80-100%: Excellent performance status, suitable for aggressive treatments
    - 60-70%: Good performance status, suitable for standard treatments with monitoring
    - 40-50%: Poor performance status, consider palliative or reduced-intensity treatments
    - 10-30%: Very poor performance status, focus on comfort care and symptom management
    - 0%: Death
    
    Treatment Eligibility Guidelines:
    - KPS â‰¥80%: Generally eligible for clinical trials and aggressive treatments
    - KPS 60-70%: May be eligible for standard chemotherapy with dose modifications
    - KPS 40-50%: Consider palliative treatments or best supportive care
    - KPS <40%: Focus on comfort care, symptom management, and quality of life

    The Karnofsky Performance Status Scale provides functional status assessment with 
    clinical interpretation and treatment recommendations. The scale ranges from 0-100% 
    and categorizes patients into functional performance levels:
    
    - Excellent Performance (80-100%): Normal activity with minimal symptoms
    - Good Performance (50-70%): Unable to work but independent at home  
    - Poor Performance (20-40%): Requires assistance and medical care
    - Very Poor Performance (10%): Moribund state
    - Death (0%): Death
    
    Clinical significance:
    - Correlates with chemotherapy tolerance and survival outcomes
    - Used for treatment eligibility and clinical trial enrollment
    - Guides treatment intensity and supportive care decisions
    - Helps assess prognosis and quality of life measures
