The immune-related adverse events (irAE) grading system for endocrine toxicities 
specifically addresses hypothyroidism induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPi). 
This grading system is based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
Version 5.0 and provides standardized criteria for assessing hypothyroidism severity 
and guiding clinical management decisions. ICPi-induced hypothyroidism is more common 
with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents than anti-CTLA-4 therapy and can occur at any time during 
treatment, often requiring lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy.

    Request model for Immune-Related Adverse Events for Endocrine Toxicities - Hypothyroidism
    
    This grading system evaluates hypothyroidism severity in patients receiving immune 
    checkpoint inhibitor therapy based on three key clinical parameters:
    
    Grading Criteria:
    - Grade 1: TSH <10 mIU/L, asymptomatic - Continue ICPi with monitoring
    - Grade 2: TSH >10 mIU/L OR moderate symptoms with ADL preservation - May hold ICPi, consider hormone replacement
    - Grade 3: Severe symptoms, unable to perform ADLs - Hold ICPi, urgent endocrinology consultation
    - Grade 4: Myxedema coma or life-threatening complications - Immediate hospitalization, IV hormone replacement
    
    Clinical Context:
    - More common with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents (pembrolizumab, nivolumab) than anti-CTLA-4
    - Can occur at any time during ICPi treatment, often irreversible
    - TSH elevation may precede clinical symptoms by weeks to months
    - Normal TSH range typically 0.4-4.0 mIU/L (varies by laboratory)
    - Most patients require lifelong thyroid hormone replacement
    
    Management Principles:
    - Grade 1: Continue ICPi, monitor TSH/free T4 every 4-6 weeks
    - Grade 2: Consider endocrinology consultation, thyroid hormone supplementation
    - Grade 3-4: Hold ICPi, urgent consultation, immediate hormone replacement
    
    Monitoring Parameters:
    - TSH and free thyroxine (T4) levels
    - Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin antibodies
    - Screen for concurrent adrenal insufficiency (up to 50% association)
    - Distinguish primary from secondary hypothyroidism

    The irAE grading system provides standardized assessment of hypothyroidism severity 
    and evidence-based management recommendations for immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced 
    thyroid dysfunction:
    
    Grade 1 (Mild): Continue ICPi with close monitoring
    Grade 2 (Moderate): May hold ICPi, consider hormone replacement
    Grade 3 (Severe): Hold ICPi, urgent endocrinology consultation
    Grade 4 (Life-threatening): Immediate hospitalization, IV hormone replacement
    
    Clinical Implications:
    - Grade 2+ typically requires endocrinology consultation and hormone replacement
    - Most patients require lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy
    - ICPi therapy can often be resumed after hormone replacement initiated
    - Monitor for concurrent adrenal insufficiency in up to 50% of cases
