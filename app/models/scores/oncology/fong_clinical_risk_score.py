The Fong Clinical Risk Score was developed at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center from 
analysis of 1,001 consecutive patients undergoing hepatic resection for colorectal liver 
metastases between 1985-1998. This simple 5-parameter scoring system predicts both overall 
survival and disease-free survival after liver resection.

The score identifies five independent prognostic factors:
1. Node-positive primary tumor (N1-N2 vs N0)
2. Disease-free interval <12 months from primary to liver metastasis
3. Multiple (>1) liver metastases 
4. Preoperative CEA level >200 ng/mL
5. Largest liver metastasis >5 cm

Clinical Application:
- Risk stratification for surgical planning
- Patient counseling regarding prognosis
- Selection for adjuvant therapy trials
- Postoperative surveillance planning
- Not intended to exclude patients from surgery

    The Fong Clinical Risk Score uses five clinical parameters to predict survival after 
    hepatic resection for colorectal liver metastases. Each parameter contributes 1 point:
    
    **Scoring Parameters (1 point each):**
    
    1. **Node-positive primary tumor**: Lymph node involvement (N1 or N2) at the primary 
       colorectal cancer site indicates more aggressive disease biology
    
    2. **Disease-free interval <12 months**: Short interval between primary resection and 
       liver metastasis detection suggests rapid disease progression
    
    3. **Multiple liver tumors**: Presence of >1 liver metastasis indicates more extensive 
       hepatic disease burden
    
    4. **Preoperative CEA >200 ng/mL**: Elevated carcinoembryonic antigen reflects high 
       tumor burden and aggressive disease
    
    5. **Largest tumor >5 cm**: Large tumor size correlates with advanced local disease 
       and potential for micrometastases
    
    **Score Interpretation:**
    - Score 0-2: Favorable prognosis (5-year survival 30-60%)
    - Score 3-5: Poor prognosis (5-year survival 11-16%)
    - Patients with scores â‰¥3 should be considered for adjuvant therapy
