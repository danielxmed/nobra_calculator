The Neuropathic Pain Scale (NPS) is designed to assess distinct pain qualities associated 
with neuropathic pain. It is only for use in patients who have already been diagnosed 
with neuropathic pain and is useful for tracking pain severity over time and monitoring 
response to treatment.

    Request model for Neuropathic Pain Scale (NPS)
    
    The NPS assesses 10 specific pain qualities on a 0-10 scale. Each pain quality 
    captures a distinct aspect of neuropathic pain experience. The scale was developed 
    specifically for monitoring treatment response in patients with established 
    neuropathic pain.
    
    Pain Quality Domains:
    1. Overall pain intensity
    2. Sharp pain ('Like a knife')
    3. Hot/burning pain ('On fire')
    4. Dull/aching pain
    5. Cold/freezing pain ('Freezing')
    6. Skin sensitivity to light touch ('Raw skin')
    7. Itchy pain
    8. Overall unpleasantness ('Intolerable')
    9. Deep pain intensity
    10. Surface pain intensity
