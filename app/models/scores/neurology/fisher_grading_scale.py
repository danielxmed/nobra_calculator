The Fisher Grading Scale is a radiological grading system for subarachnoid hemorrhage 
(SAH) that predicts the risk of cerebral vasospasm based on the amount and distribution 
of blood seen on the initial non-contrast head CT. It remains widely used despite the 
introduction of the Modified Fisher Scale, which some consider more accurate for 
vasospasm prediction.

    The Fisher Scale grades SAH based on CT findings:
    
    CT Findings Categories:
    - no_sah: No subarachnoid hemorrhage detected (Grade I)
    - diffuse_thin: Diffuse deposition or vertical layer <1mm thick (Grade II)
    - localized_thick: Localized clot and/or vertical layer â‰¥1mm thick (Grade III)
    - ich_ivh: Intracerebral or intraventricular hemorrhage with diffuse or no SAH (Grade IV)
    
    Vasospasm Risk by Grade:
    - Grade I: Low risk (0-21%)
    - Grade II: Low risk (0-25%)
    - Grade III: Low to high risk (23-96%)
    - Grade IV: Low to moderate risk (0-35%)
    
    Note: The paradoxically lower vasospasm risk in Grade IV compared to Grade III 
    is a known limitation of the original Fisher scale.

    The Fisher scale provides a grade from I to IV based on the initial CT findings,
    which correlates with the risk of developing cerebral vasospasm. Grade III has
    the highest risk of vasospasm (23-96%), while Grade IV paradoxically has a
    lower risk (0-35%).
