Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CPP) is the net pressure gradient that drives oxygen 
delivery to cerebral tissue. It represents the pressure available to perfuse the 
brain and is calculated as the difference between mean arterial pressure (MAP) 
and intracranial pressure (ICP).

Formula: CPP = MAP - ICP

Clinical Significance:
- Critical parameter in neurocritical care and traumatic brain injury management
- Guides therapeutic interventions to maintain adequate cerebral blood flow
- Helps prevent secondary brain injury from cerebral ischemia
- Essential for monitoring patients with intracranial hypertension

Normal Values and Interpretation:
- Normal range: 60-80 mmHg
- Optimal for TBI: 60-70 mmHg
- Critical threshold: <50 mmHg (high risk of cerebral ischemia)
- Target maintenance: Avoid CPP <60 mmHg and >100 mmHg when possible

Measurement Requirements:
- MAP: Preferably via arterial line, measured at tragus level
- ICP: Requires invasive monitoring (intraventricular catheter preferred)
- Continuous monitoring preferred over isolated measurements

    Request model for Cerebral Perfusion Pressure calculation
    
    Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (CPP) is calculated using two hemodynamic parameters:
    
    Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP):
    - Driving pressure for cerebral blood flow
    - Normal range: 70-100 mmHg
    - Can be measured directly via arterial line (preferred)
    - Can be calculated: MAP = (Systolic BP + 2 ร Diastolic BP) รท 3
    - Should be measured at the level of the tragus for brain injury patients
    
    Intracranial Pressure (ICP):
    - Pressure opposing cerebral blood flow
    - Normal range: 5-15 mmHg (adults), 3-7 mmHg (children), 1-5 mmHg (infants)
    - Requires invasive monitoring via intraventricular catheter (gold standard)
    - Elevated ICP (>20 mmHg) indicates intracranial hypertension
    
    Clinical Applications:
    - Traumatic brain injury management and monitoring
    - Intracranial hypertension assessment
    - Neurocritical care optimization
    - Post-neurosurgical monitoring
    - Stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage management
    - Guide therapeutic interventions (vasopressors, ICP reduction)
    
    The calculation provides immediate assessment of cerebral perfusion adequacy
    and guides critical care decisions to prevent secondary brain injury.

    Provides comprehensive CPP assessment including:
    - Calculated CPP value (MAP - ICP)
    - Clinical category and risk stratification
    - Management recommendations based on CPP level
    - Detailed calculation breakdown for clinical context
    
    CPP Categories and Clinical Management:
    
    Critical (<30 mmHg):
    - Critical risk of cerebral ischemia and brain death
    - Immediate aggressive intervention required
    - Emergency neurosurgical consultation indicated
    
    Severely Low (30-50 mmHg):
    - High risk of cerebral ischemia and secondary brain injury
    - Urgent intervention needed for cerebral perfusion optimization
    - Consider vasopressor support and ICP reduction measures
    
    Low (50-60 mmHg):
    - Below optimal range with moderate ischemia risk
    - Consider interventions to improve cerebral perfusion
    - Close neurological monitoring required
    
    Optimal (60-80 mmHg):
    - Target range for cerebral perfusion in most patients
    - Maintain current management with continued monitoring
    - Preferred range for traumatic brain injury management
    
    Adequate (80-100 mmHg):
    - Adequate perfusion with monitoring for complications
    - Balance perfusion needs with hemodynamic stability
    
    High (>100 mmHg):
    - Risk of complications from elevated pressures
    - Monitor for cerebral edema and respiratory complications
    - Balance perfusion needs with pressure management
    
    Clinical Impact: CPP-guided therapy has been shown to improve outcomes 
    in traumatic brain injury and other neurocritical conditions by maintaining 
    adequate cerebral blood flow while preventing secondary brain injury.
