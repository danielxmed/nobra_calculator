The ACE Score is a screening tool that quantifies exposure to adverse childhood 
experiences during the first 18 years of life. It was developed from the seminal 
CDC-Kaiser Permanente study that found strong correlations between childhood trauma 
and adult health outcomes. The score ranges from 0-10, with each "yes" response 
adding one point to the total score.

    Request model for Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Score
    
    The ACE Score assesses 10 categories of adverse childhood experiences:
    
    Abuse Categories:
    - Emotional abuse: Verbal abuse or threats of physical harm
    - Physical abuse: Physical violence that caused marks or injury  
    - Sexual abuse: Sexual contact by someone â‰¥5 years older
    
    Neglect Categories:
    - Emotional neglect: Lack of love, support, or family closeness
    - Physical neglect: Inadequate food, clothing, protection, or medical care
    
    Household Dysfunction Categories:
    - Parental separation/divorce
    - Mother treated violently (domestic violence)
    - Household substance abuse (alcohol or drugs)
    - Household mental illness (depression, suicide attempts)
    - Household member incarceration
    
    Each category is scored as "yes" (1 point) or "no" (0 points), with total 
    scores ranging from 0-10. Higher scores indicate greater exposure to childhood 
    trauma and increased risk for adverse health outcomes in adulthood.

    Response model for Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Score
    
    The ACE Score ranges from 0-10 points and provides risk stratification:
    - 0 points: No ACEs - Low risk for health problems
    - 1-3 points: Low to Moderate risk - Some increased risk exists
    - 4-5 points: High risk - Significant risk for health problems
    - 6+ points: Very High risk - Strong recommendation for trauma-informed care
    
    Higher ACE scores are associated with increased risks of:
    - Mental health disorders (depression, anxiety, PTSD, suicide)
    - Substance use disorders (alcohol, drugs, smoking)
    - Chronic diseases (heart disease, diabetes, cancer, stroke)
    - Risky behaviors (early sexual activity, multiple partners)
    - Social problems (unemployment, relationship difficulties)
    
    However, the ACE score is not deterministic - many people with high scores 
    lead healthy, productive lives, especially with appropriate support and 
    trauma-informed interventions.
