The Glasgow Modified Alcohol Withdrawal Scale (GMAWS) is a clinical assessment tool 
designed to evaluate and monitor the severity of alcohol withdrawal symptoms in 
hospitalized patients. It is a modified version of the Clinical Institute Withdrawal 
Assessment for Alcohol-Revised (CIWA-Ar) scale, adapted specifically for use in 
general hospital settings as part of the Glasgow Assessment and Management of 
Alcohol (GAMA) protocol.

Key Clinical Applications:
- Assessment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome severity
- Guide benzodiazepine dosing and administration frequency
- Monitor patient response to treatment interventions
- Identify patients at risk for severe complications (delirium tremens)
- Standardize alcohol withdrawal management across healthcare providers

The GMAWS evaluates five key clinical domains that are commonly affected in alcohol 
withdrawal syndrome. Each component is scored from 0-2 points, providing a total 
score range of 0-10 points. The scale is designed to be administered by trained 
healthcare professionals and should not be used in intoxicated patients (must be 
at least 8 hours since last alcohol consumption).

Clinical Context and Validation:
The GMAWS has been validated for use in general hospital settings and provides a 
systematic approach to alcohol withdrawal assessment that enables consistent evaluation 
across different healthcare providers. The scale helps standardize treatment protocols 
and ensures appropriate monitoring frequency based on symptom severity.

    Request model for Glasgow Modified Alcohol Withdrawal Scale (GMAWS)
    
    The GMAWS provides systematic assessment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome using 
    five clinical domains, each scored from 0-2 points. This standardized approach 
    enables consistent evaluation and appropriate treatment guidance across healthcare 
    settings and providers.
    
    **CLINICAL ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK**:
    
    **Assessment Prerequisites**:
