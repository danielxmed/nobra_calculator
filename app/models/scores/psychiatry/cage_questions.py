The CAGE questionnaire is a widely used 4-question screening tool for detecting potential
alcohol use disorders. The acronym CAGE is derived from key words in each question:
Cut down, Annoyed, Guilty, and Eye-opener. A score of 2 or more indicates a positive
screen with >90% sensitivity for alcohol disorders.

    Request model for CAGE Questions for Alcohol Use
    
    The CAGE questionnaire consists of 4 yes/no questions that screen for 
    problematic alcohol use. Each "yes" answer scores 1 point:
    
    Cut down: Assesses recognition of problematic drinking
    - Indicates awareness that drinking may be excessive
    - Suggests internal conflict about alcohol consumption
    
    Annoyed: Evaluates defensive reactions to feedback
    - Reflects social consequences of drinking
    - May indicate denial or resistance to acknowledging problems
    
    Guilty: Explores emotional consequences
    - Suggests moral distress about drinking behavior
    - Can indicate awareness of negative impacts
    
    Eye-opener: Screens for physical dependence
    - Morning drinking to relieve withdrawal symptoms
    - Strong indicator of physiologic dependence
    - Even if isolated, warrants serious concern
    
    Clinical Context:
    - Designed for adults and adolescents >16 years
    - Takes <1 minute to administer
    - Recommended in primary care, ED, psychiatric, and hospital settings
    - Particularly important for at-risk populations (pregnant women, students, legal issues)

    The CAGE score ranges from 0-4 points:
    
    Scoring:
    - 0-1 points: Negative screen
    - 2-4 points: Positive screen (>90% sensitivity for alcohol disorders)
    
    Special Considerations:
    - A positive eye-opener response alone is concerning for physical dependence
    - Score â‰¥2 warrants further evaluation with tools like AUDIT or clinical interview
    - This is a screening tool, not a diagnostic test
    
    Next Steps for Positive Screen:
    - Detailed alcohol history (quantity, frequency, pattern)
    - Physical examination for signs of alcohol use disorder
    - Laboratory testing (liver function, CBC, etc.)
    - Consider referral to addiction specialist
    - Use additional tools: AUDIT, MAST, or clinical interview
    
    Limitations:
    - Does not assess quantity or frequency of drinking
    - Cannot diagnose Alcohol Use Disorder without clinical assessment
    - May have lower sensitivity in certain populations
