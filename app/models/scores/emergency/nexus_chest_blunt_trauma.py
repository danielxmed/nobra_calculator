The NEXUS Chest Decision Instrument uses 7 criteria to determine which blunt trauma 
patients require chest imaging. With 99% sensitivity for clinically significant 
thoracic injury, it can safely reduce unnecessary imaging and radiation exposure.

    The NEXUS Chest evaluates 7 criteria to identify patients at very low risk for 
    thoracic injury who can potentially avoid chest imaging:
    
    1. Age > 60 years
    2. Rapid deceleration mechanism (fall > 20 ft or MVC > 40 mph)
    3. Chest pain
    4. Intoxication
    5. Altered mental status
    6. Distracting painful injury
    7. Tenderness to chest wall palpation
    
    If ALL criteria are absent (score = 0), chest imaging can potentially be avoided.
