The Behavioral Pain Scale (BPS) was developed in 2001 specifically for critically ill 
intubated patients who cannot self-report pain. It evaluates three behavioral domains: 
facial expression, upper limb movements, and compliance with mechanical ventilation.

    Request model for Behavioral Pain Scale (BPS)
    
    The BPS is a validated pain assessment tool designed specifically for critically ill 
    intubated patients who cannot self-report their pain. It is recommended in the 2018 
    PADIS guidelines as one of the two most accurate behavioral pain scales for ICU patients.
    
    Assessment Components:
    
    1. **Facial Expression (1-4 points):**
       - 1: Relaxed - no tension visible in facial muscles
       - 2: Partially tightened (e.g., brow lowering) - slight facial muscle tension
       - 3: Fully tightened (e.g., eyelid closing) - obvious facial muscle tension
       - 4: Grimacing - severe facial distortion indicating significant distress
    
    2. **Upper Limb Movements (1-4 points):**
       - 1: No movement - arms relaxed, no defensive movements
       - 2: Partially bent - slight flexion of arms or hands
       - 3: Fully bent with finger flexion - marked flexion with defensive posturing
       - 4: Permanently retracted - severe contracture or persistent withdrawal
    
    3. **Compliance with Mechanical Ventilation (1-4 points):**
       - 1: Tolerating movement - accepts ventilator breaths without resistance
       - 2: Coughing but tolerating ventilation for most of the time - occasional resistance
       - 3: Fighting ventilator - frequent dyssynchrony with ventilator
       - 4: Unable to control ventilation - complete ventilator dyssynchrony
    
    **Clinical Guidelines:**
    - Target population: Critically ill intubated patients unable to self-report
    - Assessment timing: At rest and during noxious stimuli
    - Frequency: Once per shift or when analgesia changes
    - Pain threshold: Scores â‰¥6 indicate unacceptable pain requiring intervention
    
    **Validation Evidence:**
    - Validated in surgical, trauma, and medical ICU populations
    - Good psychometric properties and reliability
    - Particularly applicable to mechanically ventilated patients
    - One of two recommended scales in 2018 PADIS guidelines (with CPOT)
    
    **Clinical Context:**
    Approximately 75% of ICU patients report severe pain, with 30% experiencing pain 
    at rest and 50% during nursing procedures. The BPS helps identify and quantify 
    this pain in patients who cannot communicate verbally.

    Response model for Behavioral Pain Scale (BPS)
    
    Returns the calculated BPS score with detailed interpretation including:
    - Pain level classification (No Pain: 3, Mild Pain: 4-5, Unacceptable Pain: 6-11, Maximum Pain: 12)
    - Component breakdown showing specific behavioral indicators
    - Clinical management recommendations based on pain level
    - Intervention guidelines for different pain thresholds
    
    The BPS provides a systematic approach to assess pain in critically ill intubated 
    patients, helping healthcare providers make appropriate pain management decisions 
    in ICU settings where traditional pain assessment is not possible.
    
    **Clinical Thresholds:**
    - Score 3: No pain, continue current management
    - Scores 4-5: Mild pain, consider comfort measures
    - Scores 6-11: Unacceptable pain, administer analgesia/sedation
    - Score 12: Maximum pain, immediate intervention required
    
    **Assessment Guidelines:**
    - Use at rest and during noxious stimuli
    - Assess once per shift or when analgesia changes  
    - Reassess 15-30 minutes after interventions
    - More difficult to use in deeply sedated patients
    
    Reference: The BPS is particularly applicable to mechanically ventilated patients 
    as one of its three domains specifically pertains to compliance with ventilation, 
    making it uniquely suited for intubated ICU patients.
