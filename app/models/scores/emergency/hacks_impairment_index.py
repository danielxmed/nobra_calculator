The HII provides a quantitative, standardized assessment of alcohol-induced impairment 
in emergency department patients. It evaluates five domains (speech/mentation, gross motor, 
eye movement, coordination, and fine motor skills), each scored 0-4, to create an objective 
measure that is superior to blood alcohol levels for assessing clinical impairment.

    Request model for Hack's Impairment Index (HII)
    
    The HII assesses five key domains of function to quantify alcohol-induced impairment:
    
    1. Speech Quality and Mentation (0-4 points):
       - 0: Normal or baseline speech; conversive and appropriate
       - 1: Mildly impaired speech clarity or slight confusion
       - 2: Moderately slurred speech or confusion
       - 3: Severely slurred speech or significant confusion
       - 4: Unintelligible speech or only moans
    
    2. Gross Motor Skills (0-4 points):
       - 0: Can stand and walk, and is steady
       - 1: Can stand and walk but unsteady
       - 2: Can stand with assistance
       - 3: Can sit up but cannot stand
       - 4: Cannot sit up
    
    3. Eye Movement (0-4 points):
       - 0: No nystagmus; follows finger with eyes whole time
       - 1: Mild nystagmus or occasional difficulty following
       - 2: Moderate nystagmus or frequent difficulty following
       - 3: Severe nystagmus or rare ability to follow
       - 4: Unable to participate
    
    4. Coordination with Target Pursuit (0-4 points):
       - 0: Steady; accurate finger to target
       - 1: Mild tremor or slight inaccuracy
       - 2: Moderate tremor or frequent misses
       - 3: Severe tremor or rare hits to target
       - 4: Unable to participate
    
    5. Fine Motor Skills (0-4 points):
       - 0: Traces curve perfectly
       - 1: Mild difficulty tracing curve
       - 2: Moderate difficulty tracing curve
       - 3: Severe difficulty tracing curve
       - 4: Unable to participate
    
    The final HII score is calculated as: (Sum of all subscores) / (Number of tasks completed Ã— 4)

    The HII score ranges from 0 to 15 points, with higher scores indicating greater impairment:
    - 0-2: Minimal impairment - consider discharge evaluation
    - 2.01-4: Mild impairment - reassess in 2 hours
    - 4.01-8: Moderate impairment - not safe for discharge
    - 8.01-12: Severe impairment - requires close monitoring
    - 12.01-15: Profound impairment - consider ICU care
    
    Clinical Significance:
    - Superior to blood alcohol levels for assessing clinical impairment
    - Serial assessments every 2 hours track improvement
    - HII <4 generally indicates readiness for discharge evaluation
    - Estimated time to resolution (hours) = HII Score / 0.0616
    
    Important Notes:
    - Not intended to determine driving safety
    - Should be used with clinical judgment and other criteria
    - Consider screening for alcohol withdrawal in appropriate patients
