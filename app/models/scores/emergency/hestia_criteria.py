The Hestia Criteria is a clinical decision tool that identifies hemodynamically stable 
patients with acute pulmonary embolism who can be safely treated as outpatients. 
Unlike scoring systems, it uses exclusion criteria - any single criterion excludes 
the patient from outpatient management.

    Request model for Hestia Criteria for Outpatient Pulmonary Embolism Treatment
    
    The Hestia Criteria uses 11 exclusion criteria to identify PE patients suitable 
    for outpatient treatment. All criteria must be absent (answered "no") for a 
    patient to be considered low risk and eligible for outpatient management.
    
    The criteria assess:
    - Hemodynamic stability
    - Need for advanced interventions
    - Bleeding risk
    - Oxygen requirements
    - Treatment failure
    - Pain control needs
    - Social support and comorbidities
    - Organ function
    - Special populations
    
    This tool has been validated in multiple studies showing that patients meeting 
    all criteria (0 points) have excellent outcomes with outpatient treatment, 
    including 0% mortality and 2% VTE recurrence rates.
