The Antivenom Dosing Algorithm is a unified treatment algorithm developed to assist 
with quick identification and management of patients who may benefit from treatment 
with Crotalidae Polyvalent Immune Fab (CroFabÂ®). This algorithm is specifically for 
CroFab dosing in pit viper (crotaline) envenomations and should not be used for coral 
snakes or non-US indigenous snakes. The algorithm emphasizes achieving initial control 
through addressing all three components: arrest of local effects, resolution of systemic 
effects, and reduction of hematologic abnormalities.

    Request model for Antivenom Dosing Algorithm
    
    This algorithm assists with CroFab dosing for pit viper (crotaline) snakebites including:
    - Rattlesnakes
    - Copperheads  
    - Cottonmouths/Water moccasins
    
    Clinical Assessment Parameters:
    
    Signs of Envenomation:
    - Local: Swelling, tenderness, redness, ecchymosis, or blebs at bite site
    - Hematologic: Elevated PT/INR, decreased fibrinogen or platelets
    - Systemic: Hypotension, bleeding beyond puncture site, refractory vomiting, 
      diarrhea, angioedema, neurotoxicity
    
    Severity Grades:
    - None: No signs of envenomation
    - Minimal: Local effects only, stable vital signs, normal coagulation
    - Moderate: Progressive local effects or mild systemic/hematologic effects
    - Severe: Severe local effects with tissue threat, significant systemic effects, 
      or severe coagulopathy
    
    Treatment Algorithm:
    - Initial dose: 4-6 vials (up to 12 for severe cases)
    - Additional dose: 4-6 vials if initial control not achieved in ~1 hour
    - Maintenance: 2 vials every 6 hours for 3 doses (at 6, 12, 18 hours)
    
    Contraindications/Exclusions:
    - Snakebites on head or neck
    - Snakebites causing rhabdomyolysis  
    - Anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions to venom
    - Coral snake envenomation
    - Non-US indigenous snakes

    The algorithm provides initial CroFab dosing recommendations:
    - 0 vials: No treatment needed (no signs of envenomation)
    - 4-6 vials: Standard initial dose for minimal to moderate envenomation
    - 6-12 vials: Higher initial dose for severe envenomation
    
    Initial Control Definition (all three must be achieved):
    1. Arrest: Progression of local effects has stopped
    2. Resolve: Systemic effects are improving/resolving  
    3. Reduce: Hematologic abnormalities normalizing or trending toward normal
    
    Follow-up Care:
    - Monitor for recurrent coagulopathy up to 1-2 weeks
    - Bleeding precautions for 2 weeks (no contact sports, elective surgery, dental work)
    - Laboratory follow-up at 2-3 days and 5-7 days post-discharge
    - Return precautions for worsening swelling, abnormal bleeding, serum sickness symptoms
