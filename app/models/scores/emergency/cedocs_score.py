The Community Emergency Department Overcrowding Scale (CEDOCS) estimates the severity 
of overcrowding in community emergency departments. Developed specifically for community 
EDs with varying patient volumes, making it more broadly applicable than other scales 
like NEDOCS which were designed for academic centers.

The CEDOCS formula incorporates:
- Critical care patients in ED (number requiring critical care)
- Waiting time of longest admitted patient (minutes)
- Number of patients in waiting room
- Total ED patients to ED beds ratio
- Annual ED visit volume (for volume-based adjustments)
- Optional scaling factor (default 2.0)

CEDOCS Score Levels:
- Level 1 (1-20): Not busy - Normal operations
- Level 2 (21-60): Busy - Increased activity
- Level 3 (61-100): Extremely busy but not overcrowded
- Level 4 (101-140): Overcrowded - Threshold exceeded  
- Level 5 (141-180): Severely overcrowded
- Level 6 (181-200): Dangerously overcrowded

Overcrowding is defined as CEDOCS score > 100.

    Request model for CEDOCS Score for Emergency Department Overcrowding
    
    The CEDOCS Score uses 6 main parameters to assess ED overcrowding levels:
    
    Core ED Status Parameters:
    - critical_care_patients: Number of patients requiring critical care (ICU-level care)
    - longest_wait_time_minutes: Waiting time of longest admitted patient (boarding time)
    - waiting_room_patients: Number of patients waiting to be seen
    - total_ed_patients: Total current ED census (all patients in department)
    - ed_beds: Licensed ED bed capacity
    
    Volume Context:
    - annual_ed_visits: Annual visit volume (for volume-based adjustments)
    - scaling_factor: Optional multiplier for institutional calibration (default 2.0)
    
    The formula includes complex cubic spline adjustments based on annual visit 
    thresholds to account for different ED sizes and patient mix patterns.
    
    Clinical Applications:
    - Real-time overcrowding assessment for resource allocation
    - Objective measurement for quality improvement initiatives
    - Decision support for diversion protocols and emergency staffing
    - Research tool for studying ED operations and patient flow
    
    Validation: Appropriate for community EDs with â‰¥18,000 annual visits.

    - Level 2 (21-60): Busy - Monitor patient flow
    - Level 3 (61-100): Extremely busy but not overcrowded
    - Level 4 (101-140): Overcrowded - Implement protocols
    - Level 5 (141-180): Severely overcrowded - Emergency measures
    - Level 6 (181-200): Dangerously overcrowded - Crisis intervention
    
    Clinical Impact:
    - Enables objective resource allocation decisions
    - Standardizes overcrowding assessment across institutions
    - Supports research and quality improvement initiatives
    - Provides evidence for staffing and operational decisions
    
    The calculation includes volume-based adjustments using cubic splines
    to account for different ED sizes and patient complexity patterns.
