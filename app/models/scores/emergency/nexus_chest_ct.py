The NEXUS Chest CT-All decision instrument uses 7 criteria to identify blunt trauma 
patients who can safely avoid CT chest imaging. With 99.0% sensitivity for all 
thoracic injuries and 100% sensitivity for aortic and great vessel injuries, it 
provides a reliable tool for selective imaging in hemodynamically stable patients.

    Request model for NEXUS Chest CT Decision Instrument
    
    The NEXUS Chest CT-All version evaluates 7 criteria to determine need for CT imaging:
    
    1. Abnormal chest X-ray (showing any thoracic injury or widened mediastinum)
    2. Distracting injury
    3. Chest wall tenderness
    4. Sternal tenderness
    5. Thoracic spine tenderness
    6. Scapular tenderness
    7. Rapid deceleration mechanism (fall >20 feet or MVA >40 mph)
    
    If ANY criteria are positive, major or minor thoracic injury cannot be excluded 
    and CT chest should be considered.
