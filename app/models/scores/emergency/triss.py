The TRISS methodology combines physiological (Revised Trauma Score) and anatomical 
(Injury Severity Score) indices with patient age to predict probability of survival 
in trauma patients. It is primarily used for quality assurance and benchmarking 
in trauma care systems.

    Request model for Trauma Score and Injury Severity Score (TRISS)
    
    TRISS estimates probability of survival using:
    - Trauma mechanism (blunt vs penetrating)
    - Revised Trauma Score (RTS): physiological derangement
    - Injury Severity Score (ISS): anatomical injury severity
    - Age (dichotomized at 54 years)
    
    Formula: Probability = 1/(1 + e^(-b))
    where b = b0 + b1(RTS) + b2(ISS) + b3(Age factor)
    
    Coefficients differ between blunt and penetrating trauma:
    - Blunt: b0=-1.2470, b1=0.9544, b2=-0.0768, b3=-1.9052
    - Penetrating: b0=-0.6029, b1=1.1430, b2=-0.1516, b3=-2.6676
