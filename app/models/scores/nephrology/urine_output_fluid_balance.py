The Urine Output and Fluid Balance calculator assesses renal function and fluid status by
calculating the urine output rate per kg body weight per hour. This tool helps identify
oliguria, polyuria, and fluid imbalances in hospitalized patients, particularly those 
at risk for acute kidney injury.

Clinical significance:
- Normal urine output: 1.0-2.0 mL/kg/hr (800-2000 mL/24h in adults)
- Oliguria: <0.5 mL/kg/hr for >6 hours (<400 mL/24h)
- Anuria: <0.3 mL/kg/hr or <50 mL/24h
- Polyuria: >2.0 mL/kg/hr (>3000 mL/24h or >50 mL/kg/24h)

Fluid balance calculation helps assess net fluid retention or loss, important for
management of critically ill patients and those with cardiovascular or renal disease.

    Request model for Urine Output and Fluid Balance Calculator
    
    This calculator assesses renal function and fluid status by measuring urine output
    rate and calculating fluid balance over a specified collection period.
    
    Parameters:
    - weight_kg: Patient body weight in kilograms (1-300 kg)
    - urine_output_ml: Total urine output in milliliters during collection period (0-10000 mL)
    - collection_hours: Duration of collection period in hours (1-48 hours)
    - fluid_intake_ml: Total fluid intake in milliliters during same period (0-20000 mL)
    
    The calculator determines urine output rate using the formula:
    Urine Output Rate (mL/kg/hr) = Total Urine Output (mL) / (Weight (kg) Ã— Collection Hours)
    
    Normal ranges:
    - Normal: 1.0-2.0 mL/kg/hr
    - Oliguria: 0.3-0.5 mL/kg/hr  
    - Anuria/Severe Oliguria: <0.3 mL/kg/hr
    - Polyuria: >2.0 mL/kg/hr

    Response model for Urine Output and Fluid Balance Calculator
    
    Returns the calculated urine output rate, fluid balance, and clinical interpretation.
    
    The urine output rate is expressed in mL/kg/hr and categorized as:
    - Anuria/Severe Oliguria: <0.3 mL/kg/hr (critical, requires immediate intervention)
    - Oliguria: 0.3-0.5 mL/kg/hr (concerning, monitor closely)
    - Normal Low: 0.5-1.0 mL/kg/hr (acceptable but monitor trends)
    - Normal: 1.0-2.0 mL/kg/hr (optimal range)
    - Polyuria: >2.0 mL/kg/hr (investigate underlying causes)
    
    Fluid balance indicates net fluid retention (positive) or loss (negative).
    Values >500 mL positive suggest fluid overload, while <-500 mL suggests dehydration.
