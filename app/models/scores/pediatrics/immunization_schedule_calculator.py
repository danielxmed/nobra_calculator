The Immunization Schedule Calculator is a clinical decision support tool that determines what 
immunizations/vaccinations are due based on patient's age according to CDC vaccination guidelines. 
This tool helps healthcare providers identify appropriate vaccinations for pediatric and adult 
patients based on standardized immunization schedules. The calculator provides general vaccination 
recommendations but requires clinical judgment and knowledge of patient's vaccination history for 
optimal use.

    Request model for Immunization Schedule Calculator
    
    The calculator determines vaccination recommendations based on patient age according to CDC guidelines:
    
    Age Groups:
    - under_2_years: Infants and toddlers (0-23 months) - requires age_months parameter
    - 2_years_and_over: Children and adults (2-120 years) - requires age_years parameter
    
    Vaccination Schedules:
    - Infant Schedule (0-23 months): Primary vaccination series including DTaP, Hib, IPV, PCV13, 
      RV, MMR, Varicella, Hepatitis A/B, and others according to CDC pediatric schedule
    - Child/Adolescent Schedule (2-17 years): Catch-up vaccinations, boosters, HPV series, 
      meningococcal vaccines, and annual influenza
    - Adult Schedule (18+ years): Annual influenza, Tdap/Td boosters, pneumococcal vaccines, 
      zoster vaccine, and risk-based recommendations
    
    Clinical Considerations:
    - Patient's complete vaccination history must be considered
    - Contraindications include immunocompromised state for live vaccines
    - Pregnancy is a contraindication for live vaccines
    - High-risk conditions may require additional vaccines
    - Catch-up schedules apply for delayed vaccinations

    The response provides vaccination recommendations based on CDC immunization schedules:
    
    Schedule Categories:
    - Pediatric Schedule (0-23 months): Focuses on primary vaccination series with specific timing
    - Child/Adolescent Schedule (2-17 years): Emphasizes catch-up vaccinations and boosters
    - Adult Schedule (18+ years): Concentrates on routine adult vaccines and age-specific recommendations
    
    Key Vaccination Components:
    - Primary Series: Initial vaccinations for disease protection (DTaP, MMR, etc.)
    - Booster Doses: Reinforcement of immunity (Tdap every 10 years)
    - Annual Vaccines: Yearly recommendations (influenza)
    - Age-Specific: Vaccines recommended at certain ages (HPV at 11-12 years, zoster at 50+)
    - Risk-Based: Additional vaccines for high-risk individuals
    
    Clinical Applications:
    - Routine vaccination scheduling for healthy individuals
    - Catch-up immunizations for delayed schedules
    - Travel medicine preparation
    - Occupational health assessments
    - Patient counseling and education
