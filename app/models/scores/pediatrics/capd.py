The CAPD is a validated, rapid observational tool for screening delirium in pediatric patients 
aged 0-21 years. It assesses eight behavioral domains through routine nursing observations, 
requiring no patient participation and taking less than 2 minutes to complete.

Clinical Background:

Pediatric Delirium Epidemiology:
- Affects 20-25% of pediatric ICU patients
- Associated with increased mortality, longer ICU stays, and functional disability
- Often under-recognized without systematic screening tools
- Can occur across all pediatric age groups from neonates to young adults
- Risk factors include critical illness, mechanical ventilation, and medications

CAPD Development and Validation:
- Developed specifically for pediatric populations with developmental considerations
- Based on DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for delirium
- Validated across age groups from 0-21 years with developmental anchor points
- Sensitivity 94.1% overall, with age-specific performance variations
- Can be used in both developmentally normal and delayed children

Eight Assessment Domains:

Domain Structure:
Each domain is scored 0-4 points based on frequency of observed behaviors:
- 0 points = Always/Never (most typical behavior)
- 1 point = Often/Rarely  
- 2 points = Sometimes
- 3 points = Rarely/Often
- 4 points = Never/Always (most atypical behavior)

Domain 1 - Makes Eye Contact with Caregiver:
Assesses social engagement and awareness of interpersonal environment.
- Scored: Always (0) to Never (4)
- Clinical Significance: Eye contact reflects attention and social awareness
- Developmental Context: Varies by age from basic visual tracking to complex social interaction
- Assessment Method: Observe during routine care interactions

Domain 2 - Actions are Purposeful:
Evaluates goal-directed behavior and cognitive organization.
- Scored: Always (0) to Never (4)  
- Clinical Significance: Purposeful actions indicate intact cognitive function
- Developmental Context: Age-appropriate purposeful behavior varies significantly
- Assessment Method: Observe during play, feeding, and care activities

Domain 3 - Aware of Surroundings:
Assesses environmental awareness and orientation.
- Scored: Always (0) to Never (4)
- Clinical Significance: Environmental awareness reflects attention and consciousness level
- Developmental Context: Developmentally appropriate environmental responses
- Assessment Method: Note responses to people, sounds, and environmental changes

Domain 4 - Communicates Needs and Wants:
Evaluates communication effectiveness and clarity.
- Scored: Always (0) to Never (4)
- Clinical Significance: Communication reflects cognitive organization and attention
- Developmental Context: Age-appropriate communication methods (crying, gestures, words)
- Assessment Method: Observe during care needs and comfort provision

Domain 5 - Restless:
Assesses psychomotor agitation and hyperactive behaviors.
- Scored: Never (0) to Always (4)
- Clinical Significance: Restlessness may indicate hyperactive delirium subtype
- Developmental Context: Normal activity levels vary significantly by age
- Assessment Method: Observe during awake periods and care interactions

Domain 6 - Inconsolable:
Evaluates emotional regulation and response to comfort measures.
- Scored: Never (0) to Always (4)
- Clinical Significance: Inconsolability reflects emotional dysregulation in delirium
- Developmental Context: Age-appropriate comfort responses and self-soothing
- Assessment Method: Observe responses to comfort measures and caregiver interaction

Domain 7 - Underactive (Very Little Movement While Awake):
Assesses psychomotor retardation and hypoactive behaviors.
- Scored: Never (0) to Always (4)
- Clinical Significance: Underactivity may indicate hypoactive delirium subtype
- Developmental Context: Normal activity patterns vary by age and developmental stage
- Assessment Method: Observe movement patterns during awake periods

Domain 8 - Takes Long Time to Respond to Interactions:
Evaluates response time and processing speed.
- Scored: Never (0) to Always (4)
- Clinical Significance: Delayed responses reflect cognitive processing difficulties
- Developmental Context: Expected response times vary by developmental stage
- Assessment Method: Observe latency to respond during interactions and care

Scoring and Interpretation:

Scoring Method:
- Total score: Sum of all 8 domains (0-32 points)
- Delirium threshold: â‰¥9 points indicates positive screen
- Score optimization: Threshold chosen to maximize sensitivity (94.1%)
- Clinical context: Higher scores indicate more severe delirium symptoms

Age-Specific Performance:
- Ages 0-13 years: High sensitivity and specificity
- Ages 13-21 years: Reduced sensitivity (50%), high specificity (98.1%)
- Developmental considerations: Anchor points guide age-appropriate assessment
- Special populations: Validated in both normal and developmentally delayed children

Clinical Implementation:

Assessment Requirements:
- Performed by bedside nurses during routine care
- No patient participation required (observational only)
- Takes less than 2 minutes to complete
- Should be performed every nursing shift
- Excludes deeply sedated patients (similar to adult tools)

Training and Competency:
- Requires brief training on developmental anchor points
- Inter-rater reliability improved with standardized training
- Reference charts available for bedside use
- Practice with diverse age groups recommended

Quality Assurance:
- Document assessment timing and clinical context
- Note factors that may influence behavioral observations
- Consider developmental stage and baseline function
- Record interventions and response to treatment

Clinical Applications:

Screening Programs:
- Universal screening for all pediatric ICU patients
- Integration with pediatric early warning systems  
- Quality improvement initiatives for delirium reduction
- Research applications for pediatric delirium studies

Management Integration:
- Triggers pediatric delirium management protocols
- Guides medication review and optimization
- Informs family education and support needs
- Supports discharge planning and follow-up care

Special Considerations:

Developmental Factors:
- Premature infants: Adjusted for corrected gestational age
- Developmental delays: Assess relative to individual baseline
- Cultural considerations: Account for cultural differences in behavior
- Language barriers: Focus on non-verbal behavioral observations

Environmental Context:
- ICU setting may alter normal behavioral patterns
- Separation from family affects behavioral assessment
- Medical devices and procedures influence behavior
- Medication effects on behavior and cognition

Limitations and Considerations:
- Observational tool requiring clinical judgment
- May be less sensitive in certain age groups
- Requires understanding of normal developmental patterns
- Should be used as part of comprehensive delirium assessment
