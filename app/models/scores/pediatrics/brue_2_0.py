The BRUE 2.0 criteria improves on the original BRUE classification by providing 
sophisticated risk prediction models for serious underlying conditions and event 
recurrence. It uses derived mathematical models to calculate quantitative risk 
percentages rather than binary risk categories, enabling more nuanced clinical 
decision-making and resource allocation.

    Request model for Brief Resolved Unexplained Events 2.0 (BRUE 2.0) Criteria
    
    BRUE 2.0 Entry Criteria (ALL must be met):
    1. Infant <1 year old
    2. Asymptomatic on presentation (no URI symptoms, no fever)
    3. No explanation for event after history and physical exam
    4. History of sudden, brief, and now resolved episode
    
    Event Characteristics (â‰¥1 must be present):
    - Cyanosis or pallor
    - Absent, decreased, or irregular breathing
    - Marked change in tone (hyper or hypotonia)
    - Altered level of responsiveness
    
    Risk Prediction Models:
    1. Serious Condition Risk: Uses age in days, history of similar events, and abnormal medical history
    2. Recurrence Risk: Uses multiple factors including prematurity, event clusters, and specific characteristics
    
    Key Improvements over Original BRUE:
    - Quantitative risk prediction rather than binary classification
    - Age as continuous variable (days) rather than categorical
    - Enhanced risk stratification for clinical decision-making
    - Validated prediction models for serious diagnoses and recurrence
