The Body Roundness Index (BRI) is a geometric assessment of body shape based on the 
principle of body eccentricity. It estimates body fat percentage and visceral adipose 
tissue using only waist circumference and height measurements. Unlike BMI, BRI accounts 
for central adiposity and has shown superior predictive ability for cardiometabolic 
risk and all-cause mortality. The index demonstrates a U-shaped mortality curve, with 
both very low and very high values associated with increased mortality risk.

    Request model for Body Roundness Index (BRI)
    
    The BRI is calculated using a mathematical formula based on the geometric principle 
    of body eccentricity. It models the human body as an ellipse to estimate body fat 
    and visceral adipose tissue distribution.
    
    **Measurement Guidelines:**
    
    **Waist Circumference:**
    - Measured at the level of the umbilicus (navel)
    - Patient should be standing with feet together
    - Arms should be at the sides
    - Measurement taken at the end of normal expiration
    - Tape measure should be snug but not compressing the skin
    - Parallel to the floor
    
    **Height:**
    - Measured without shoes
    - Standing against a wall or stadiometer
    - Head in Frankfurt plane (looking straight ahead)
    - Heels together, touching the wall
    
    **Clinical Applications:**
    
    **Metabolic Risk Assessment:**
    - BRI correlates with insulin resistance and diabetes risk
    - Better predictor than BMI for metabolic syndrome
    - Accounts for visceral adiposity distribution
    
    **Cardiovascular Risk:**
    - Associated with hypertension and dyslipidemia
    - Predicts cardiovascular events
    - U-shaped curve for mortality risk
    
    **Body Composition:**
    - Estimates percentage body fat
    - Correlates with DEXA scan measurements
    - Reflects central obesity patterns
    
    **Advantages over BMI:**
    - Accounts for body shape, not just weight
    - Better correlation with visceral fat
    - More accurate in muscular individuals
    - Considers fat distribution patterns
    
    **Limitations:**
    - Relatively new index requiring validation
    - May not apply equally to all ethnicities
    - Does not differentiate muscle from fat mass
    - Requires accurate waist measurement

    Response model for Body Roundness Index (BRI)
    
    The BRI value represents the degree of body roundness, with higher values 
    indicating a more spherical body shape and increased health risks. The index 
    typically ranges from 1 to 20, with most adults falling between 3 and 7.
    
    **Interpretation Guidelines:**
    
    **BRI < 3.41 (Low):**
    - May indicate lower body fat
    - Paradoxically associated with moderate mortality risk
    - Consider assessment for malnutrition or muscle wasting
    - HR 0.57 (95% CI 0.49-0.67) vs reference
    
    **BRI 3.41-4.45 (Below Average):**
    - Generally favorable body composition
    - No significant increase in health risks
    - HR 0.81 (95% CI 0.69-0.95) vs reference
    
    **BRI 4.45-5.46 (Average/Reference):**
    - Reference range for mortality comparisons
    - Low risk for visceral obesity complications
    - Baseline hazard ratio (HR 1.0)
    
    **BRI 5.46-6.91 (Above Average):**
    - Increased body roundness and health risks
    - Consider lifestyle interventions
    - HR 1.48 (95% CI 1.30-1.69) vs reference
    
    **BRI â‰¥6.91 (High):**
    - Significantly increased health risks
    - Strong recommendation for intervention
    - HR 1.62 (95% CI 1.42-1.85) vs reference
    
    **Clinical Decision Making:**
    
    **Risk Stratification:**
    - Use alongside other metabolic markers
    - Consider family history and comorbidities
    - Account for age and ethnicity factors
    
    **Intervention Thresholds:**
    - BRI >5.46: Consider lifestyle counseling
    - BRI >6.91: Aggressive risk factor modification
    - Monitor trends over time
    
    **Follow-up Recommendations:**
    - Low/High BRI: Reassess in 6 months
    - Average BRI: Annual screening
    - Track changes with interventions
