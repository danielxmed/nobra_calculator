The Menza Score is a risk prediction tool that estimates the 4-year probability of 
HIV acquisition among men who have sex with men (MSM). Developed using data from 
sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics and validated in HIV prevention trials, 
it incorporates key behavioral and clinical risk factors to identify individuals who 
would benefit most from intensified HIV prevention interventions including pre-exposure 
prophylaxis (PrEP).

    Request model for Menza Score HIV risk prediction for MSM
    
    The Menza Score uses four key risk factors to predict 4-year HIV acquisition risk:
    
    Risk Factors and Point Values:
    1. STI History (gonorrhea, chlamydia, or syphilis): 4 points if yes
    2. Methamphetamine or nitrite use (prior 6 months): 11 points if yes
    3. Unprotected anal intercourse with HIV+/unknown partner (prior year): 1 point if yes
    4. 10+ male sexual partners (prior year): 3 points if yes
    
    Score Interpretation:
    - 0 points: <5% 4-year HIV risk
    - 1-3 points: 5-9% 4-year HIV risk
    - 4-11 points: 10-14% 4-year HIV risk
    - â‰¥12 points: >14% 4-year HIV risk
    
    Clinical Context:
    This score was developed using data from 1,903 MSM attending STI clinics (2001-2008) 
    and validated in 2,081 participants from Project Explore (1999-2003). In the development 
    cohort, annual HIV incidence was 2.57%. The score emphasizes substance use (particularly 
    methamphetamine and nitrites) as the most heavily weighted risk factors.

    The Menza Score provides a 4-year HIV risk estimate to guide prevention interventions.
    Key applications include:
    - Identifying candidates for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)
    - Targeting intensified HIV prevention counseling
    - Determining HIV testing frequency
    - Resource allocation for prevention programs
    
    Important Limitations:
    - Should only be used for MSM populations
    - Not intended as sole criterion for PrEP eligibility
    - Based on behavioral data from 1999-2003
    - Validation studies showed decreased sensitivity for Black MSM
    - Individual risk may vary based on local HIV epidemiology
