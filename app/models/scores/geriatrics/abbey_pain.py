    Request model for Abbey Pain Scale calculation
    
    The Abbey Pain Scale is a validated tool for assessing pain in people with dementia
    who cannot verbally communicate their pain experience.
    
    **Clinical Use**:
    - Pain assessment in dementia patients
    - Non-verbal pain evaluation
    - Monitoring pain management effectiveness
    - Care planning in aged care facilities
    - Quality of life assessment
    - Medication adjustment guidance
    
    **Assessment Domains**:
    1. Vocalization (whimpering, groaning, crying)
    2. Facial expression (grimacing, frowning, distorted expressions)
    3. Body language (guarding, rigidity, fidgeting, withdrawal)
    4. Behavioral change (increased confusion, refusing food, alteration in usual patterns)
    5. Physiological change (temperature, pulse, blood pressure changes, perspiring, flushing/pallor)
    6. Physical change (skin tears, pressure areas, arthritis, contractures, previous injuries)
    
    **Scoring**: Each domain scored 0-3 (0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe)

    - Score 0-2: No pain - continue routine monitoring
    - Score 3-7: Mild pain - consider non-pharmacological interventions

    **Management Strategies**:
    - Non-pharmacological: repositioning, comfort measures, environmental modifications
    - Mild pain: paracetamol, topical analgesics, heat/cold therapy
    - Moderate pain: regular analgesics, consider opioids for breakthrough pain
    - Severe pain: regular opioids, specialist pain management consultation
    
    **Monitoring Recommendations**:
    - Reassess after interventions (15-30 minutes for medications)
    - Document response to treatments
    - Regular reassessment (every 4-8 hours or as needed)
