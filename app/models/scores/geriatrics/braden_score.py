The Braden Scale is a clinically validated assessment tool developed in 1987 to 
predict pressure ulcer risk. It evaluates six subscales: sensory perception, 
moisture, activity, mobility, nutrition, and friction/shear. Lower scores indicate 
higher risk, with a total score range of 6-23 points. The tool is widely used 
across various healthcare settings to guide preventive interventions.

    Request model for Braden Score for Pressure Ulcers
    
    The Braden Scale assesses six factors to determine pressure ulcer risk:
    
    1. Sensory Perception (1-4 points):
       - 1: Completely limited - unresponsive to painful stimuli
       - 2: Very limited - responds only to painful stimuli
       - 3: Slightly limited - responds to verbal commands with limitations
       - 4: No impairment - responds normally to pressure discomfort
    
    2. Moisture (1-4 points):
       - 1: Constantly moist - skin always damp
       - 2: Very moist - often damp, linen changed once per shift
       - 3: Occasionally moist - extra linen change once daily
       - 4: Rarely moist - skin usually dry
    
    3. Activity (1-4 points):
       - 1: Bedfast - confined to bed
       - 2: Chairfast - cannot walk, must be assisted to chair
       - 3: Walks occasionally - short distances with/without assistance
       - 4: Walks frequently - outside room 2x/day minimum
    
    4. Mobility (1-4 points):
       - 1: Completely immobile - no position changes without help
       - 2: Very limited - occasional slight changes only
       - 3: Slightly limited - frequent slight changes independently
       - 4: No limitation - major frequent position changes
    
    5. Nutrition (1-4 points):
       - 1: Very poor - never eats complete meal, <2 protein servings/day
       - 2: Probably inadequate - eats ~50% of meals, 3 protein servings/day
       - 3: Adequate - eats >50% of meals, 4 protein servings/day
       - 4: Excellent - eats most meals, 4+ protein servings/day
    
    6. Friction and Shear (1-3 points):
       - 1: Problem - requires maximum assistance, frequent sliding
       - 2: Potential problem - minimal assistance, some sliding
       - 3: No apparent problem - moves independently

    The Braden Score stratifies patients into five risk categories:
    - No Risk (19-23 points): Continue routine care
    - Mild Risk (15-18 points): Basic preventive measures

    - High Risk (10-12 points): Aggressive prevention measures
    - Very High Risk (â‰¤9 points): Maximum prevention interventions
