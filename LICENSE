## 2) Clinical Use Addendum

> **Purpose.** This addendum clarifies conditions and restrictions for **healthcare, clinical, or biomedical** use of this software, in addition to Apache-2.0. In case of conflict, this addendum governs such clinical/healthcare use. For all other uses, Apache-2.0 alone applies.

### 2.1. Intended Use

* **Research & Education.** The software is provided primarily for **research, development, validation, and educational** purposes. It is **not intended** to independently diagnose, treat, cure, mitigate, or prevent diseases, nor to replace professional clinical judgment.

### 2.2. Clinical Deployment Conditions

If you deploy, integrate, or use the software in any **clinical workflow, healthcare service, or product** that may influence patient care or clinical decisions, you **must** comply with **all** conditions below:

1. **Qualified Oversight.** Use only under the supervision of **licensed healthcare professionals** with expertise appropriate to the context of use, who retain full responsibility for all clinical decisions.
2. **Validation.** Perform and document **local clinical validation** demonstrating safety, performance, accuracy, and fitness for the intended use, including limitations across relevant populations and settings.
3. **Regulatory Compliance.** Determine whether your intended use renders the software a **regulated medical device** (e.g., SaMD/CDS). If so, you must obtain and maintain **all applicable authorizations** and comply with all regulatory requirements in each jurisdiction (e.g., **ANVISA** in Brazil, **FDA** in the USA, **EU MDR** in the European Union), including **quality management**, **risk management**, **post-market surveillance**, and **reporting** obligations.
4. **Risk Management.** Establish a documented **risk management process** (e.g., according to recognized standards) covering hazard identification, risk analysis/assessment, mitigation, monitoring, and contingency plans.
5. **Human Factors & Disclosures.** Provide clear **user-facing notices** describing intended use, limitations, contraindications, data requirements, uncertainty, and failure modes. Interfaces must avoid automation bias and support clinician review.
6. **Auditability.** Maintain **audit logs** of inputs, model versions, parameters, and outputs used in clinical contexts, allowing reconstruction and review of decisions.
7. **Data Protection.** Comply with all applicable **data protection and privacy laws** (e.g., **LGPD** in Brazil) and implement appropriate **security controls**, including encryption, access control, and data minimization.
8. **No Emergency Reliance.** Do **not** rely solely on this software for **time-critical or life-sustaining** decisions or emergency care without validated redundancies and fail‑safes.
9. **Attribution & Notices.** Preserve **NOTICE** and license headers in all copies, include a link to the project, and state prominently that the software is used **with professional oversight** and is **not a substitute for clinical judgment**.

### 2.3. No Warranties; Limitation of Liability

This software is provided **“AS IS”**, without warranties or conditions of any kind, express or implied, including without limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, non-infringement, or error-free operation. **To the maximum extent permitted by law**, the authors, copyright holders, and contributors shall **not be liable** for any claim, damages, losses, or costs arising from or related to the software or its use, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

> **Additional Healthcare Limitation.** Without limiting the foregoing, in no event shall the authors, copyright holders, or contributors be liable for **clinical outcomes**, **diagnostic or therapeutic decisions**, **adverse events**, **loss of data**, or **regulatory non-compliance** resulting from deployment of the software in healthcare contexts.

### 2.4. Indemnification

You agree to **defend, indemnify, and hold harmless** the authors, copyright holders, and contributors from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to your clinical/healthcare use, deployment, or distribution of the software, including any claim of regulatory violation, product liability, malpractice, privacy or data protection breach, or third-party claims.

### 2.5. Updates; Model Drift

Clinical users are responsible for monitoring **updates, configuration changes, and model drift**, re‑validating performance when versions, parameters, data sources, or environments change in ways that may impact safety or effectiveness.

### 2.6. Governing Law & Venue

Except where prohibited by local law, this addendum and any dispute arising from clinical/healthcare use shall be governed by the **laws of Brazil**, and the parties elect the **Court of the Capital District of the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil**, with express waiver of any other, however privileged it may be. The **Portuguese** version of this addendum shall prevail over translations.

### 2.7. Severability

If any provision of this addendum is held unenforceable, that provision shall be severed or reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.
